Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday took a swipe at Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, questioning whether chanting “Jai Samvidhaan” (Long live Constitution) is allowed in Parliament, while alleging that those in power were not stopped from raising unparliamentary slogans. Her statement followed the swearing-in of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor from Thiruvananthapuram as a member of the 18th Lok Sabha. Tharoor took his oath in English while holding a copy of the Constitution and concluded with “Jai Hind, Jai Samvidhaan.” Opposition members echoed Tharoor’s chant of “Jai Samvidhaan,” prompting the Speaker to remind them that they were already taking their oaths on the Constitution. Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda from Haryana argued that the Speaker should not have objected. The Speaker retorted, “Don’t give advice on what to object to and what not to. Sit down.”

Reacting to this, Priyanka Gandhi posted on X, “Can't ‘Jai Samvidhaan’ be chanted in the Indian Parliament? Those in power were not stopped from raising unparliamentary and unconstitutional slogans in Parliament, but objections were raised when an opposition MP chanted ‘Jai Samvidhaan’. The anti-constitution sentiment that emerged during the elections has now taken a new form, seeking to weaken our Constitution. “The Constitution by which Parliament functions, the Constitution by which every member takes an oath, the Constitution by which every citizen gets the protection of life and livelihood—will this same Constitution now be opposed to suppress the voice of the opposition?” she questioned.

The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha began on Monday with the swearing-in of all newly elected Members of Parliament and will run until July 3. Following the two-day swearing-in ceremony, the election for the Lok Sabha Speaker was held on June 26.

Om Birla was elected as Speaker for second consecutive term. Opposition leaders made a strong point by repeatedly mentioning their increased strength in the House and exhorting the Speaker to be ‘neutral and impartial’.

Meanwhile, in a post on X, former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar accused Congress of betraying the people of Wayanad and concealing its intentions.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/emergency-was-biggest-attack-on-constitution-president-murmu-5980028#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories,President's Address Adds Fire To BJP's Emergency Offensive Against Congress,"Amid the burning issue of NEET, President Droupadi Murmu said the government is fully committed to investigate the recent incidents of paper leaks. The Emergency imposed in 1975 was the darkest chapter of a direct attack on the Constitution, President Droupadi Murmu said today in her address to a joint sitting of Parliament. This is her first address to Parliament after the general election elected a new Lok Sabha.
The Constitution, she said, has stood up to every challenge and every test in the past decades. ""Today is 27th June. The imposition of Emergency on 25th June, 1975, was the biggest and darkest chapter of direct attack on the Constitution. The entire country felt outraged.""

""But the country emerged victorious over such unconstitutional forces as the traditions of the republic lie at the core of India,"" she said, amid cheers from the treasury benches and protests by the Opposition. Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar echoed the President on the Emergency and said it had ""attacked the Constitution"". 

The President's remark comes against the backdrop of a heated exchange between the ruling BJP and the Opposition on Emergency. While central ministers, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have stressed on the horrors of the Emergency imposed by the Indira Gandhi government, the Congress and its allies have said an ""undeclared emergency"" is in the force over the past 10 years of Narendra Modi government.

The President's remarks also play out in the context of the Opposition's Constitution push. In demonstrations outside the House and proceedings inside it, Opposition MPs have been holding up copies of the Constitution and accusing the ruling party of undermining it.

""My Government also does not consider the Constitution of India as just a medium of governance; rather we are making efforts to ensure that our Constitution becomes a part of public consciousness,"" the President said in her address.

The President's address to Parliament is broadly a document that outlines the government's achievements and lays out is vision for the future. The address is essentially prepared by the government and is followed by a debate on the Motion of Thanks.

India, the President said, has become the fastest growing major economy in the world and has gone from the 11th spot in 2014 to the 5th in terms of the size of economy. She said the government is now focused on its goal of making India the third-largest economy. ""The government is giving equal priority to all three arms: manufacturing, services and agriculture. India is becoming Atmanirbhar in every field at a rapid pace.""

The President's address also touched upon the burning issue surrounding irregularities in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), an all-India exam for admission to medical courses.

The government, she said, is fully committed to investigating the recent incidents of paper leaks and ensure that the guilty are punished. As she made the remarks, cries of ""NEET"" were heard from the Opposition benches.

""Sanctity, transparency are a must in government recruitments and examinations. The government is committed to conduct fair investigation and ensure the most stringent punishment to those guilty in the recent incidents of paper leak,"" she said, adding that there is a need to rise above ""partisan politics"" and take strong steps on this issue.

Stressing on the need for the Parliament to run smoothly, she said opposition of policies and obstruction of parliamentary functioning are different.

""When Parliament conducts its business smoothly, when healthy deliberations take place here, when far-reaching decisions are taken, then the people repose confidence not only in the Government but also in the entire system. Therefore, I am confident that every moment of Parliament will be fully utilised and public interest will be given priority,"" she said.

According to a letter released by the Congress and sent by Venugopal to the Speaker, “Making of such a political reference from the Chair is unprecedented in the annals of history of Parliament.”

“I am writing this in the context of a very grave matter impacting upon the very credibility of the institution of Parliament. Yesterday, that is 26 June 2024, at the time of offering felicitations on your election as Speaker Lok Sabha, there was a general camaraderie in the House as such occasions generate,” he said in the letter.  “However, what followed thereafter, which is a reference from the Chair after your acceptance speech, in regard to the declaration of Emergency half a century ago, is deeply shocking. Making of such a political reference from the Chair is unprecedented in the annals of the history of Parliament. This coming from the Chair as one of the ‘first duties’ from a newly elected Speaker assumes even graver proportions,” he added.

“I, on behalf of the Indian National Congress, express our profound concern and anguish over this travesty of Parliamentary traditions,” he said.

On Wednesday (June 26th), Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla condemned the ‘dictatorial’ proclamation of Emergency that was announced by the previous Congress government led by then PM Indira Gandhi in 1975. He described it as the black chapter in India’s history. He also asked the House to observe 2 minutes of silence to mourn the ‘murder of democracy’, a day after the country entered the 50th year of Emergency that started in June 1975.  

Addressing the Lok Sabha, Om Birla said, “This house condemns the Emergency that was imposed in 1975 in the strongest terms. We also laud the determination of all those who staunchly opposed the Emergency, struggled, and performed the duty of safeguarding India’s democracy. 25th June 1975 will always be remembered as a black chapter in Indian history. On that day, then PM Indira Gandhi imposed an Emergency in the country and made a major blow to the constitution drafted by Dr BR Ambedkar.” The Lok Sabha speaker further slammed the erstwhile Congress-led government for imposing dictatorship on India. He also highlighted the excesses which were committed during the Emergency period.

Om Birla asserted, “Our young generation should know about the black phase of democracy. During the dark phase of the Emergency, scores of people lost their lives at the hands of Congress’ dictatorial government. We (the house) will observe 2 minutes of silence in their honor.”  

Notably, the Lok Sabha speaker made these remarks after PM Modi introduced ministers to the LS.

New Delhi: The 'sengol' installed next to the Speaker's chair in Lok Sabha has emerged as the latest flashpoint this Parliament session after Opposition MPs questioned its relevance in a democracy and the BJP accused them of disrespecting Indian culture.
The ongoing debate over 'sengol', a handcrafted, gold-plated sceptre about 5-feet long, has been triggered by Samajwadi Party MP RK Chaudhary's letter to Speaker Om Birla. The MP from Mohanlalganj has said the 'sengol' must be replaced by a copy of the Constitution.

""The adoption of the Constitution marked the beginning of democracy in the country, and the Constitution is its symbol. The BJP government in its last term installed 'sengol' next to the Speaker's chair. Sengol is a Tamil word that means sceptre. Rajdand also means the king's stick. We have become independent after the age of kings. Now, every man and woman who is an eligible voter chooses the government to run this country. So will the country run by Constitution or by a king's stick?"" he told news agency ANI. The former Uttar Pradesh minister demanded that the 'sengol' be replaced by a copy of the Constitution to ""save democracy"".  The Samajwadi Party is the third-largest party in this Lok Sabha, after Akhilesh Yadav led it to a stellar show by winning 37 seats in Uttar Pradesh.

Asked about his party MP's remark, Mr Yadav said, ""When 'sengol' was installed, the Prime Minister had bowed to it. But he forgot to bow while taking oath this time. I think our MP wanted to remind the Prime Minister about it.""

Senior Congress leader and MP B Manickam Tagore echoed the Samajwadi Party MP on the 'sengol' row. ""We have been very clear that the 'sengol' symbolises kingship and the kingdom-era is over. We should celebrate the people's democracy and the Constitution,"" he told NDTV.

Mr Chaudhary's demand was also backed by RJD MP and Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Misa Bharti. ""Whosoever has demanded this, I welcome it,"" she said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the Samajwadi Party has no respect for Indian history or culture. ""The remarks of their top leaders on the Sengol are condemnable and indicate their ignorance. It also shows INDIA bloc's hatred to Tamil culture in particular,"" Yogi Adityanath said. The Opposition's 'sengol' offensive also plays out against the backdrop of the INDIA bloc's Constitution push to take on the third Narendra Modi government. From the beginning of this session, the Constitution has been a common sight in the Opposition's gatherings. On the first day of the session, top INDIA leaders Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, among others, staged a demonstration on Parliament premises holding copies of the Constitution. The INDIA MPs, including Mr Gandhi and Mr Yadav, also held copies of the Constitution while taking the oath.

The BJP, meanwhile, has hit back at the Opposition over its 'sengol' offensive. ""The Samajwadi Party earlier attacked and abused Ramcharitmanas and now Sengol, which is part of Indian culture and particularly Tamil culture. The DMK must clarify if they support this insult of 'sengol',"" he said.


During the 'sengol's installation in Lok Sabha last year, Home Minister Amit Shah had said it was an attempt to link our cultural traditions with our modernity. ""We want the administration to run by the rule of law, and this will always remind us of that,"" he said.





",https://www.opindia.com/2024/06/parliament-building-sengol-how-opposition-politicians-have-been-focusing-on-needless-controversies/,"New Parliament building, now Sengol: How Opposition politicians have been focusing on needless controversies instead of doing their jobs","The I.N.D.I. Alliance following ten years in opposition and three unsuccessful efforts to oust Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has reverted to its old strategies of raising frivolous issues to criticize the recently elected administration, instead of making better use of their time. Now, they have picked ‘Sengol‘ which was installed next to the speaker’s chair in Lok Sabha as a symbol of India’s sovereignty to demonstrate their lack of genuine concerns and demanded its removal from the newly constructed Indian parliament.

Samajwadi Party MP RK Chaudhary wrote to pro-tem speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab on 25th June and questioned its presence in the parliament. He stated, “Today, I took oath in this honourable chamber that ‘I will bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of India as by law established’ but I was shocked to see the ‘Sengol’ on the right side of the chair of the house. The constitution is a sacred document and the symbol of India’s democracy while ‘Sengol’ is a symbol of monarchy.”

Chaudhary added, “In its previous tenure, the BJP government under the leadership of PM Modi installed ‘Sengol’ in parliament. ‘Sengol’ means ‘Raj-Dand.’ It also means ‘Raja ka Danda.’ After ending the princely order, the country became independent. Will the country be run by ‘Raja ka Danda’ or the constitution? Our parliament is a temple of democracy, not a palace of some king or royal. I demand that ‘Sengol’ be removed from parliament and replaced by a large replica of the constitution.”  Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav supported his party leader and claimed, “When ‘Sengol’ was installed, the Prime Minister had bowed to it but he forgot to bow while taking oath this time. I think our MP wanted to remind him about it.” Senior Congress leader and MP B Manickam Tagore echoed the same sentiment and voiced, “We have been very clear that the ‘Sengol’ symbolises kingship and the kingdom-era is over. We should celebrate the people’s democracy and the constitution.” Rashtriya Janata Dal MP and Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter Misa Bharti also declared, “Whosoever has demanded this, I welcome it.”

RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha too joined the chorus and alleged, “We had protested and said that ‘Sengol’ is a symbol of the monarchy when it was being installed in the parliament. Our PM has the conduct of the kings.” He then brought up issues including jewellery, dresses, mangalsutra and mujra among others which were used by the prime minister to expose the opposition during his election campaign. The parliamentarian then added, “Now, only these topics will be discussed in the country. It is better to put a big replica of the constitution there which will run the nation.”  Notably, the Congress, its ideological sister parties and their ecosystem have historically found a profound delight in demeaning India’s cultural and historical symbols in the name of democracy, secularism, and the constitution and ‘Sengol’ was no exception. Interestingly, they never find any other religion or its symbol to be at odds with India’s democracy. 

How Congress reduced ‘Sengol’ to a mere walking stick
Lord Mountbatten asked Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, over the appropriate cultural symbol to signify the transfer of power when it was agreed that the British would cede control to the Indians and end their colonial rule. The latter took some time and spoke with C Rajagopalachari about the issue who informed Jawaharlal Nehru about the ‘Sengol’ after reading several books on history. The ‘Sengol’ was then sent to the first prime minister of India by the head of the Thiruvaduthurai Mutt Sri La Sri Ambalavana Desika Swamigal, who agreed to its use as a symbol of power.

The practice was evocative of the ancient customs of the Chola dynasty where it was customary for spiritual leaders known as Samayacharyas to oversee the crowning of kings and sanctify the transfer of power, a symbolic gesture of approval for the ruler. The sceptre received by Pandit Nehru was crafted from silver and plated with gold, on a special order from the Adheenam. This was handcrafted by jeweler Vummidi Bangaru Chetty in Madras and served as a replica of the original ‘Sengol’ however, it was highly revered as it symbolised the glorious tradition of the great Chola empire.

The sacred sceptre, shockingly, was soon forgotten and was housed as “Jawahar Lal Nehru’s golden walking stick” at a Prayagraj museum. The true origins and reasons for a significant artifact being displayed in a museum as a walking stick remained unknown, but it has now been rightfully recognized and honoured in the new Parliament under the Modi government. However, gauging from the actions of the Congress-led opposition in the present, it is evident how a momentous symbol was reduced to a mere footnote in the annals of history during their time as the only centre of authority in the nation.

Opposition and their persistent tendency to inflate non-issues
The opposition, in their eagerness to attack the Bharatiya Janata party-led National Democratic Alliance, has resorted to making absurd accusations instead of focusing on real problems and offering constructive criticism. The opposition even opposed PM Modi’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project which involved the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue, the area between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate. The most significant part of the project was the construction of a new parliament building. Rahul Gandhi in all his wisdom had even tweeted, “Central Vista-not essential. Central Government with a vision-essential.” Sitaram Yechury, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also denounced the administration, charging it with “circumventing” the shutdown.

Ironically, it was the vision of the Modi government which addressed the significant issue of the impending expansion of the parliament owing to the increased population which nearly quadrupled since independence. The Delhi High Court and Supreme Court also denied petitions against the project, further embarrassing the opposition. In another display of utter ignorance or perhaps goodwill for India’s British rulers, the opposition even slammed the government for renaming “Rajpath” which meant Kingsway to “Kartavya Path” which translates to the path of duty.

Opposition had issues with the lions in the national emblem installed over the new parliament building
The mockery of Indian voters who elected their representatives to address important matters reached new heights when opposition leaders suggested that the lions in the national emblem which was erected on top of the new parliament building were “fiercer and had sharper teeth” in comparison to the original statue in Sarnath. The politicians and their lackeys charged that the lions looked angry whereas they should be ‘peaceful’ and ‘calm’ and accused the Modi government of changing the national emblem.

Six people were arrested after the mob attack on Fareed (35) on Tuesday night in Mamu Bhanja locality, police said. Seven people, part of the mob, have been identified.

According to a complaint filed by the victim's family, Fareed was returning home from work when he was mobbed and thrashed by some residents on Tuesday night in the Mamu Bhanja locality over suspicion of theft, Superintendent of Police City M Shekhar Pathak said. By the time police reached the spot, Fareed was seriously injured and was rushed to the Malkhan Singh Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, the SP said.

As the news of the incident spread, many people gathered at the hospital and demanded the arrest of the accused, he said.

Pathak said the arrests have been made based on CCTV footage, and some other unidentified people have also been booked. Further investigation is underway.

SSP Sanjay Suman told the reporters that all precautionary measures have been enforced. Police and RAF (Rapid Action Force) have been deployed in sensitive localities including Subzi Mandi and Abdul Kareem Chowk.
The sector scheme has been enforced in all sensitive areas of the city, he added.

Meanwhile, people from both Hindu and Muslim communities gathered at some spots in the old city near Railway Road and some shops shut down their shutters, he said.

Police patrolling has been intensified in some areas identified as ""sensitive spots"", he added.

Several BJP leaders led by the city MLA Muktar Varshney staged a ""dharna"" near the Railway Road, demanding that no innocent person should be arrested based on fabricated evidence.
SP Pathak assured that arrests will be made following the due process of law.

These assertions were endorsed by elements like Mohammad Zubair as well. On the 18th of June 2024, a Muslim man called Mohammed Farid, who was also known as “Aurangzeb” was killed after being beaten up by Hindus in  Aligarh. According to the  Aligarh police, Aurangzeb had entered a Hindu house with the intention to steal. Thereafter, he was caught hold by the family and beaten up, leading to his death. 

The Aligarh police in their statement said that the Hindus and Muslims had both protested, however, contrary to some media reports there were no incidents of stone pelting reported from the area.

The incident occurred in the Mamu Bhanja locality around 10:15 PM on Tuesday and the deceased has been identified as Mohammed Farid alias Aurangzeb (35), a resident of the Ghas Ki Mandi locality.

The police arrested 6 Hindus after filing an FIR against 10 named accused and dozens of unidentified Hindus accused.

While the police said the situation was under control and there was no law and order issue in the locality, on Wednesday, Hindu and Muslim groups protested demanding justice.

The Hindu side demanded that those arrested should be released, while the Muslim side demanded justice for Aurangzeb, who had entered a Hindu house late at night.

Samajwadi Party (SP) leader came out in defense of Aurangzeb. “No one has the right to take the law in their hands. Even if there was suspicion of Aurangzeb being a thief, he should have been handed over to the police. None had any right to beat the man to death even if there was a suspicion,” local Samajwadi Party leader Ajju Ishaq, who led the protest against the incident, said. “The country will run by the Constitution and law of land and a man, even if suspect, cannot be lynched on religious identity.”

On the other hand, BJP leader Mukta Raja has said that those Hindu boys arrested are innocent and are being falsely framed. She said that Aurangzeb entered the Hindu house with 4-6 other Muslim men. When caught, the others fled and Aurangzeb fell down the stairs, being caught. She has demanded a thorough investigation into the videos that have surfaced and demanded that no innocent person be punished.

On social media, Islamists and the usual elements, who give unbridled covering fire to Islamists, have started giving the ‘Muslim victimhood’ spin to the incident.

Zeyad Masroor Khan, who is a journalist and has worked with Reuters, Vice, DH, and Brut India, claimed that Aurangzeb had ‘gone to meet a friend and entered a neighborhood home by mistake’. Meer Faisal, whose misinformation about Hindus was used by ISIS to call for the genocide of Hindus, said that the mob which lynched Aurangzeb was a “Hindutva mob”.  Alishan Jafri, another Islamist who calls himself a journalist termed the incident an “anti-Muslim attack”. The lies were actively peddled by Mohammad Zubair of AltNews as well. With this dangerous narrative being peddled by the usual suspects, furthering the eternal Muslim victimhood narrative, it becomes imperative to analyze the publicly available information about this case and how the Islamists are indulging in the usual chicanery to blame Hindus and paint the thief as an innocent Muslim man who was lynched for his religious identity.

The FIR in the case was based on the complaint filed by Aurangzeb’s brother. Mohammed Zaki alleged that Aurangzeb was returning home from work when he was mobbed and thrashed by some residents in the Mamu Bhanja locality around 10:15 PM. “They (accused) gathered with the intention of killing brother Aurangzeb. They had lathi, stick, hockey (stick) and iron rod in hand and attacked my brother after identifying him as a Muslim, they killed him,” the complainant has alleged in the FIR.

After the police confirmed that Aurangzeb had indeed entered the house of a Hindu on Tuesday night, elements like Zeyad Masroor Khan started claiming that he was returning home from a friend’s place and had entered a ‘neighborhood house by mistake’. These assertions were endorsed by elements like Mohammad Zubair as well.

This narrative, needless to say, makes very little sense. The brother of the accused has claimed that Aurangzeb was innocently returning home and on his way, he was “identified as a Muslim and lynched to death”. This assertion is debunked immediately after the police have confirmed that he indeed did enter a Hindu house with the intention to steal. The goalpost shift by OGWs claiming that he entered the Hindu house “by mistake” is outlandish, to say the least. They are essentially claiming that while walking on the road, a 35-year-old man, for no apparent reason, simply “by mistake” entered a random house that happened to be one of a Hindu. Nobody enters strange houses late at night, with no ‘intention’ and ‘by mistake’. This is a narrative being peddled simply to demonize Hindus and paint the thief as an innocent Muslim victimized for his religious identity.

Now that it has been established that Aurangzeb did enter a Hindu house late at night, it becomes important to analyze the claim that he was lynched owing to his Muslim identity.

If a strange man enters the house where a family is dwelling late at night, it is unthinkable that the family would first ask the intruder his religious identity before deciding to defend themselves. In a house with women and children, the first instinct, I daresay, would be to assume the worst and with force, if necessary, defend the life and honor of the family from the intruder. To assume that the family, whose house was broken into, would first ask the religious identity of the intruder and spare the perpetrator if he turned out to be a Hindu and defend themselves only if the perpetrator was a Muslim is a myopic narrative furthered only to paint Islamists as the eternal victims.

The narrative about Aurangzeb being beaten up for his Muslim identity is one being furthered by the SP leader Ajju Ishaq and the Islamists on social media, who pretend to be journalists and commentators.

Of course, ideally, nobody should take the law into their own hands and Aurangzeb should have been handed over to the police for further investigation and action. However, defending oneself and one’s family from intruders is human instinct, which in this case led to an illegal action, however, the reaction of the family and the locals would have been the same regardless of the religious identity of the perpetrator. Therefore, to brand this incident as an anti-Muslim attack by a “Hindutva mob” is nothing more than propaganda to target Hindus.

New Delhi: The total number of eligible voters in the country shot up from 89.6 crores in 2019 to 96.8 crores in 2024. But in the first five phases of polling, a dip of ~19.4 crore (19,37,72,469) votes was recorded in the ongoing 2024 Lok Sabha elections in comparison to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, data made available by the Election Commission of India reveals.

 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 426 seats polled in the first five phases while in the 2024 polls, voting was conducted for a total of 428 constituencies, that is two seats more than in 2019. 

In 2019, 70.1 crore (70,16,69,757) votes were recorded in the first five phases, while in 2024, a total 50.7 crore (50,78,97,288) votes were recorded.

 The comparison has been made possible after the Election Commission of India, facing unprecedented and sustained public pressure, released the absolute numbers of voters for the five phases that were completed on May 20 (Monday).  

Phase One

According to the data now made available by the Election Commission, in phase 1 of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 11,00,52,103 votes were recorded across 102 seats. In comparison, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 14,20,54,978 were recorded in the first phase in which polls were conducted to 91 seats. 3.2 crore votes less have been cast in 2024, in comparison with 2019, in the first phase.  Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 1: 3,20,02,875

 Phase Two

 In the second phase of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the dip has been bigger than the first phase, of 4.9 crores (4,94,18,900). This, when the number of seats that went to polls in 2024 in the second phase were more than in 2019.

 A total of 10,58,30,572 votes were recorded across 88 seats in the second phase in 2024 in comparison to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when a total of 15,52,49,472 votes were recorded after polling to 95 seats. 

Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 2: 4,94,18,900

 Phase Three

 In the third phase of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, there has been a dip of 7.5 crore (7,52,74,480) votes recorded in comparison to the previous election. A total of 18,85,09,156 votes were recorded after polling to 117 seats in the third phase of 2019 in comparison to a total of 11,32,34,676 votes recorded after polling to 93 seats in 2024’s third phase.

Of course, in the third phase, the number of seats in which voting took place, were significantly more in 2019, as compared to 2024. 

 Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 3: 7,52,74,480

Phase Four  

In the fourth phase, the difference between the two elections is 57.9 lakhs (57,98,110). This is despite the total number of seats that voted in this phase in 2024 being 24 more than in 2019, in the same phase. 

In 2019 a total of 12,82,67,429 votes were recorded across 72 seats and in 2024 a total of 96 seats recorded 12,24,69,319 votes.  Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 4: 57,98,110

Phase Five

In the fifth phase, the difference stands at 3.1 crores (3,18,78,104). In 2019 a total of 8,75,88,722 votes were recorded after polling to 51 seats in the fifth phase while in 2024 a total of 5,57,10,618 votes have been recorded in polling to 49 seats.

In the fifth phase of polling, in 2024, two less seats voted, in comparison with the fifth phase in 2019. Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 5: 3,18,78,104

According to a press release by the Election Commission of India in February, the total number of eligible voters in 2019 there were a total of 89.6 crore voters, which increased to 96.8 crores in 2024.

Data released after sustained pressure

 The data was released on Saturday, just two days after the Election Commission told the Supreme Court that there is no legal mandate for the commission to disclose voter turnout data based on Form 17C, or the record of votes polled in each polling station, and that such disclosure could be susceptible to misuse.    

The election-conducting body has filed the affidavit in response to an application filed by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Common Cause seeking immediate publication of voter turnout data in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.  

The Supreme Court on Friday, refused to direct the Election Commission to publish voter turnout data and said that a “hands-off” approach during the elections was required as it listed the matter to be heard after summer vacations. 

The Election Commission, while supplying the numbers, again said “Commission notes the pattern of false narratives and mischievous design to vitiate electoral process.” 

2019 Phases

As in 2024, in 2019 too polling was conducted over seven phases in 2019. 

The first vote was cast on April 11 and the last one on May 19. The results were declared on May 25. The phases were however spaced closer together with voting conducted on April 11, April 18, April 23, April 29, May 6, May 12 and May 19, 2019.

On Saturday, 25th May, leftist propaganda website ‘The Wire’ published a report with dubious voter turnout data for 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In the report, they are claiming that 19.4 crore fewer voters cast their votes in the first five phases of Lok Sabha Elections 2024 compared to the 2019 General Elections. According to The Wire, 70.1 crore votes were polled in 2019 across 426 seats, while in 2024 only 50.7 crore votes were polled.

Interestingly, just over 61 crore votes were polled in total in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but leftist propaganda website ‘The Wire’ concluded that over 70 crore votes were polled in the seats that went for elections in first 5 phases in 2024, implying there was negative turnout in remaining seats. How negative turnout is possible, only the great scientists at ‘The Wire’ can explain to us..

To support their claim, The Wire used five press releases by the Election Commission of India from 2019 and the latest absolute number of data released by the agency. However, they made a big blunder in calculating the numbers as they used total electorate of 2019 and not total votes. Archived links of The Wire’s report can be seen here and here. The Press Releases linked by The Wire for phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5 can be accessed here. The latest data released by EC can be checked here. The press release of the first phase used by The Wire is from 10th April while Polling date was 11th April. Similarly, phase 2 press release was from 16th April and the polling date was 18th April. The press release for phase 3 was from 22nd April and the polling date was 23rd April. Press release for phase 4 was from 26th April and the polling date was 29th April. The press release for the fifth phase was from 3rd May and the polling date was 6th May. Polling schedule for 2019 Elections can be seen here. Notably, in the header of all five press releases, the date of press release and date of polling were clearly mentioned.Now if we check the press releases from 2019, they were released before the polling dates, and not after. These press releases only had the number of total electorates from the said constituencies and not the votes polled in those phases.

OpIndia analysed all 427 constituencies and compared the data from the actual Election Commission data that can be checked here.

As per the data, there were 71,14,40,983 total voters in 2019 in the constituencies that went to poll in the first five phases of 2024, out of which 48,47,07,015 exercised their right to vote. That means 68.13% voting. In 2024, there were 76,40,80,337 registered voters out of which 50,72,97,288 voters exercised their right to vote. That makes 66.39% voting. It is evident that though the voting percentage reduced by 1.74%, the total number of voters who cast votes increased by 2,25,90,273 (2 crore, 25 lakh, 90 thousand and 273). Please note that we compared the voter turnout data of constituencies where the polling has been done and not the constituencies that were in the first five phases of 2019. Furthermore, the names of constituencies of Assam are different from 2019 due to delimitation exercise that took place in 2023. OpIndia’s data analysis of that can be checked here.

The BJP has reiterated its stance on various issues, including historical events like the Emergency, emphasizing the need to remember and learn from the past to safeguard democratic values. On the other hand, Congress has focused on current challenges, such as the violence in Manipur, urging the government to address the immediate concerns affecting the nation.

The debates in Parliament reflect the complex balance between acknowledging historical events and dealing with contemporary problems, as both sides strive to shape the national narrative in their favor."
https://thewire.in/agriculture/india-contract-farming-ordinance-corporate-lifeline,Will India's Contract Farming Ordinance Be a Corporate Lifeline for Agriculture?,"Even though India has had a few relatively successful models, contract farming has failed to take off in a meaningful manner. Of the three agriculture-related ordinances promulgated on June 5, 2020, the most predictable was ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’.

Put simply, it provides a legal basis to the existing practice of contract farming in India’s agriculture and allied sectors.
In 2018, the Union Ministry of Agriculture circulated a model law on contract farming. It was called ‘The State /UT Agricultural Produce Contract Farming (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018’. The Ordinance draws from this model Act.

It is not that contract farming is new to India or it did not have any legal backing. Under the Model APMC Act, 2003 also, contract farming was permitted and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) were given the responsibility to record the contracts. They were also mandated to resolve the disputes in such contracts. However, market fee and other levies/charges were payable to APMCs.

Currently, contract farming requires registration with the APMC in a few states. This means that contractual agreements are recorded with the APMCs, which can also resolve disputes arising out of these contracts. Furthermore, market fees and levies are paid to the APMC to undertake contract farming.

According to Volume IV of the Dalwai Committee report, only 14 states have issued rules to govern contract farming. Despite this, it hasn’t taken off properly and only 15 companies have entered into contract farming for crops in Punjab, Haryana, MP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Most of these contracts are for cotton and barley. It is clear that contract farming is not yet mainstream.

In April 2013, the Akali government in Punjab passed the Punjab Contract Farming Act to provide a legal framework to contract farming. There were several protections in the Act to protect the interest of farmers – e.g. no recovery could be made from farmers by sale or mortgage of his land under contract. The Punjab Act did not have a provision mandating that sale cannot be below the MSP.

Due to opposition from various quarters, Punjab never notified the rules under the Act.

The Centre’s ordinance of June 5, 2020 attempts to provide a national framework for contract farming by bringing uniformity in provisions of contract farming under state regulation enacted under APMC Acts and the laws passed by some states on the lines of model Act circulated in 2018.

Basically, the Ordinance has three main features:

A farmers may enter into a written agreement which can specify terms and conditions of quality, grade, time of supply price and the extension services etc.
The agreement could be for a period of 1 to 5 years.
The price or any variation of the same has to be part of the agreement. For any additional amount over the agreed price, the prevailing price in APMC/electronic portal etc. will be the benchmark.
All contracts are to be registered with a state level authority to be set up by state governments. In addition, there are several other safeguards for farmers.

Many observers have been studying the reasons for the failure of contract farming to take off on a large scale, even though there are several examples of successful models evolving over the years. For example, seed production is mainly through contract farming between seed companies and producer farmers. The seed companies provide foundation seeds to farmers who, in turn, deliver certified seed to companies. The National Seed Corporation has a well-defined protocol for contract farming for seed production. Mostly, the farmers receive a price higher than the MSP and even the prevailing APMC prices. Generally, the farmers do not default on the delivery of seeds.

Generally the corporates, both processors and modern retailers, are reluctant to enter into formal contracts with hundreds of farmers and they use a middle man, called organiser. They fear that in case of any default by farmers, the political system will not support them irrespective of merit of the case.

For most hybrid seed production, the seed companies pay about 25% of agreed price to contract farmers on delivery of seed. Balance 75% amount is paid after conducting a genetic purity test, which is required for labelling of seed packets. This test can take about 70-80 days and farmers are paid the balance 75% of price only after this test confirms the purity of seed. The Ordinance provides for payment of 66% of seed price to farmers on delivery and 34% on certification. But the entire price has to be paid within 30 days. It has to be seen how the seed industry will adapt to this change of payment terms.

At present, informal contracts between industry and farmers are also quite common. In West Bengal, many small and marginal farmers grow chip grade potatoes under contractual arrangements, mostly without written contracts. Under this system, the company inspects the farms on a periodic basis and provides extension services.

There are apprehensions on the part of farmers to enter into contracts as they are not organised and are ill equipped for any legal battle with corporates. Only last year, a few Gujarat farmers were sued for more than Rs 1 crore for illegally growing and selling a potato variety registered by PepsiCo. On the intervention of the state government, PepsiCo withdrew the cases but the incidence left a question mark over the future of contract farming in which resource-poor farmers were pitted against a powerful multinational.

Other sectors provide a better example of what the future should look like. The most successful example of contract farming in India comes from the sugarcane and poultry sectors. An evaluation of contract farming of broilers by P.V.K. Sasidhar and Murari Suvedi found that contract farming had low marketing risk and that the farmers were promptly paid. The working capital requirement of farmers was also low and extension services were provided by the aggregator. However, the average net return per bird was Rs 11.06 for contract farmers while it was Rs 17.05 per bird for those farmers who did not participate in contract farming. So, the poultry producers under contract farming were losing Rs 5.99 per bird. This is the cost for avoiding the risk of disease, fluctuation of market prices and expert guidance from veterinarians.

On the whole, poultry farming is a successful example of small farmers benefiting from aggregators providing extension services, including feed and medicines and taking marketing risk. About 66% of poultry production is under contract farming. Poultry sector is uniquely placed as the prices of eggs are decided by the National Egg Coordination Committee, which takes demand and supply into account. So, unlike the farmers of most crops who face enormous fluctuation in prices, the poultry farmers are shielded from the same.

However, even in the US, contract farming of poultry has benefited producers more than the poultry farmers.

The top most concern of organised players wishing to enter contract farming is the place of minimum support price in their agreements. They are generally reluctant to sign agreements as they are not sure if the states will hold them accountable if the agreed price is below MSP.

A lot more clarity is required in government policy on this account.

The Ordinance provides for setting up of a registration authority in every state to electronically register the contracts. The states will do well to quickly notify the regulations governing the registration of contracts.

So far, modern retail has been largely purchasing perishable produce from mandis. Since the volumes of fresh produce are still low for modern retail and it has to compete with roadside vendors, it has been reluctant to invest in backend infrastructure.

Also read: What Will the End of the Road for APMCs Look Like?
This ordinance has the potential to change the contours of modern retail as it can expand its reach to better off consumers, willing to pay higher prices for fresh produce of higher grade which meets the standards of pesticide residue and food safety.

It is a good decision to exempt the produce under contract farming from stock limits under Essential Commodities Act. However, the Ordinance does not cover contract farming of sugarcane which will continue to be governed by Sugarcane (Control) Order 1966. It means that despite the purported concerns of Nitin Gadkari about high MSPs of several crops, as compared to global prices, the sugar mills will still have to pay fair and remunerative prices or the state advised prices. Indian sugar prices will therefore continue to be higher than global prices. MSP reforms can probably start from here.

The Ordinance says that the government will issue guidelines as well as model agreements. It means that this Ordinance is still work in progress.








",https://www.opindia.com/2021/03/gujarat-farmers-contract-farming-potatoes-benefit/,How farmers in Gujarat have benefitted with entry of private players and contract farming,"It appears that the opposition parties are opposing the new laws only because Modi government brought them in. The same old rhetoric of ‘farms will be sold to 4-5 big conglomerates’, ‘farmers will be rendered landless and exploited at the hands of few private players’ is being pushed forward by the kisan andolan leaders. The farmers agitating and holding Punjab and parts of Haryana and UP to ransom seem to be upset with farmers income doubling through open market and formalized contractual farming.

The fear mongering has made the farmers to believe that the private companies will take over their land. So let’s understand which section of the Farm Laws allows a company to buy a farmers land. Well the answer is none. There is no such provision in the Laws which enables a company to own farmers land or produce. However, this narrative is being played to mislead the farmers.


It is interesting to know that around 15 states in India have been practicing contractual farming in some way or the other.

What is contractual farming?
As explained in Krishi Jagran, contract farming is a method of agri-production where a purchaser approaches a farmer with specific requirements of production and marketing of a or multiple farm products. The farmer then offers to supply agreed-upon amounts of a given agricultural commodity as per the requirement stated in the contract. The farmer must ensure that the produce is as per purchaser’s quality requirements. In certain situations, the purchaser agrees to assist the farmer by providing necessary agricultural inputs, land planning, and technical guidance, among other things. 

Contractual farming in Indian states
Multiple states have loosely drafted bills in place for contractual farming which refrains a farmer from getting into such contracts. As mentioned by Tushar G in a Swarajya report, Punjab for example, introduced contract farming in the year 2002 under Captain Amarinder Singh’s government to decrease the share of cropped area under wheat and paddy and encourage diversification.

However, after the state government changed in 2007, stopped the financial help from UPA-led central government. This, coupled with lack of supply of good seeds, motivation to farmers and market support needed from state as well as central government were more or less absent. In 2013, the government made another attempt to pass Punjab Contract Farming Act which resembled the Farm laws but was met with strong opposition from the middlemen lobby.


In another report by the Indian Express, Maharashtra government had incorporated contract farming in its Agriculture Produce Marketing (Development and Facilitation) Act of 1964 in the year 2006. Just like the Centre’s Farm laws, Maharashtra had allowed farmers to enter into contracts with buyers to sell their produce at predetermined prices but the potential has remained untapped as retail chains have been reluctant to enter in contracts that last for a long period of time.

Role of Farm laws
What Centre has done with Farm laws is essentially weave the vaguely drafted state regulations in a watertight Act to ensure formalisation and protection of farmers and purchaser across the country promoting ‘one nation, one market’. Ensuring uniformity, the new laws have specific provisions to safeguard the interests of farmers. The Centre has repeatedly made it clear that contract farming is an option and not compulsion, selling outside of mandi is an option and not compulsion and no APMC will be shut.

Here is a brief round-up on what the new farm laws do: The land of farmers will remain with them
No buyer who gets into the contractual farming with farmers will be able to build permanent structures on the farm land.
The new farm laws say that there will be no action for recovery of dues against the farmers’ land.
Further, farmers get the choice and freedom to sell their produce to whoever they wish to. The Gujarat Model
No land has been sold to purchaser in India’s 30 years of contractual farming says a December 2020 report of online web portal DeshGujarat. In fact, the risk for farmers has gone substantially down after they got engaged into contract farming.

A moneycontrol report states that Jignesh Patel, a resident of Aravalli, Gujarat clocks Rs 25 crore annually, all thanks to contract farming. Patel’s family, who have been into potato farming for the past 26 years, began growing the LR potatoes (a special variety of potatoes) after pilot cultivation. They now produce produce 20,000 metric tonnes on an average and sell them to leading potato chips manufacturers such as Balaji and ITC.


In another report, an ITC official revealed that potato farmers in Gujarat earn as high as Rs 5 lakh per hectare. Sachid Madan, Chief Executive, fresh fruits and vegetables and frozen business, ITC said, “farmers make two times more income from growing potatoes for processing units,”. ITC is the maker of the popular potato snack brand, Bingo.

Adding to the success stories, ‘Tuber Foods Private Limited’ of Ahmedabad is all set to buy 400 tons of golden sweet potatoes at 25% higher rate than the market price from Maharajganj Vantangiya’s FPO ‘Maharajganj Vegetable Producing Company’. Specifying the deal, Ram Gulab, the director of Maharajganj Vegetable Producing Company said that the contract is for selling the produce and not the land and that contractual farming has come as a blessing for small farmers like them.


Banas Dairy, which is one of the 18 cooperative unions under the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), is setting up a Rs 100-crore (USD 13.5 million) potato processing unit in North Gujarat to take on popular and established brands like McCain Foods India Pvt Ltd and Hyfun Foods in India. The unit will have an annual capacity to process 50,000 metric tonnes of potatoes for production of French fries, a popular snack and 12 other potato products for both domestic and international markets in the South-East Asia. The company is currently procuring 7,000 metric tonne of potatoes from approximately 500 farmers in North Gujarat.

Private players working with farmers
Companies like BigBasket, Reliance Retail, Amazon, ITV, PepsiCo have been working closely with farmers to procure desired products directly, increasing farmers income by around 20%. PepsiCo still undertakes some amount of contract farming in Punjab. Punjab farmers, who had wholeheartedly embraced the reforms few years back, are not up in arms against the very same reforms at central level. It appears that the opposition parties are opposing the new laws only because Modi government brought them in.

https://thewire.in/law/hemant-soren-jharkhand-high-court,No Reason to Believe Hemant Soren Guilty of Money Laundering Offence': Jharkhand HC Gives Bail,"The HC, examining the case records and chargesheet filed by the ED, held that 'none of the registers/revenue records bare imprint of the direct involvement of the petitioner (Soren) in the acquisition and possession of the said land.' New Delhi: The Jharkhand high court on June 28 granted bail to Hemant Soren, the state’s former chief minister who had to step down before he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on January 31.

Soren has been in the Ranchi Jail since. He walked out of the jail on Friday. After his release, Soren said, “I was kept behind bars for 5 months…We are seeing how the judicial process is taking years not just days or months…Today, it is a message for the whole country that how a conspiracy was hatched against us…The fight we started and the resolutions we made, we will work to fulfil them.” Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay gave the bail order after hearing the matter for over a month.

The ED’s case is that Soren, the head of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha which is part of the opposition INDIA alliance, misused his official position and illegally acquired 8.86 acres land in Ranchi which the agency has termed as “proceeds of crime”.

Rejecting this argument of the ED, the HC has held that “there is reason to believe that the petitioner is not guilty of the offence as alleged.”

Jharkhand HC, while granting bail to Soren, also dismissed the case of the ED stating that “overall conspectus of the case based on broad probabilities does not specifically or indirectly assign the petitioner (Soren) to be involved in the acquisition and possession as well as concealment of 8.86 acres of land at Shanti Nagar, Baragain, Ranchi connected to the proceeds of crime”.

The HC, examining the case records and also the chargesheet filed by the agency, also held that “none of the registers/revenue records bare imprint of the direct involvement of the petitioner (Soren) in the acquisition and possession of the said land.” Jharkhand HC has directed Soren to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount each.

With Election Commission planning to schedule Jharkhand assembly elections in October this year along with Maharashtra and Haryana, this development is a shot in the arm for JMM and also the united opposition, INDIA.

Along with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Soren’s arrest – just before the 2024 Lok Sabha election – is highlighted as one of the ways in which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was keen to suppress political opposition. The ED, a central agency, is under the direct control of the BJP-led union government.

Many had pointed out that while the judiciary granted Kejriwal interim bail so he could campaign during the long elections, Soren’s case had not been dealt with with the same ideas.

On May 10, when the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail, it disposed of Soren’s plea challenging his arrest by the ED as “infructuous” because by then the high court had delivered an unfavourable bail judgment – only after the apex court issued notice on the former chief minister’s petition on April 29.

On February 2, just after Soren’s arrest, Champai Soren, one of the most prominent figures in the movement for the creation of the separate state of Jharkhand, took oath as CM. Soren’s wife Kalpana, along with Champai, campaigned widely for the party in the polls.

Among the tribal population of Jharkhand, The Wire‘s ground reports revealed, Soren’s arrest led to significant anti-BJP sentiments.

Hemant Soren, the former chief minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha stalwart was granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court on 28th June. Soren was arrested by the ED in January this year in connection with a money laundering case involving a land scam.

According to his attorney, Arunabh Chowdhury, the court found him not guilty of the offence. He stated, “Bail has been granted to Soren. The court has held that prima facie he is not guilty of the offence and there is no likelihood of the petitioner committing an offence when on bail.” On 13th June, the high court reserved its decision regarding his bail petition.

SV Raju, the agency’s lawyer, contended that he would do a similar crime if he was allowed bail. The 48-year-old was eventually arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on 31st January in connection with its investigation into the money-laundering case after a protracted hide-and-seek scenario. The probe was related to an illegal possession of 8.36 acres of land. The inquiry focuses on large sums of money obtained through the falsification of official records, involving “fake sellers” and buyers who used forged or counterfeit paperwork to purchase enormous tracts of land worth crores.

The Jharkhand Police filed several First Information Reports (FIRs) in land “scam” cases against various individuals, including state government officials, which led to the money laundering inquiry. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party loyalist and state transport minister Champai Soren was named as his successor after his resignation. He reporetdly tried to dodge the inteorrgataion and even skipped nine Enforcement Directorate summons. Hemant Soren who is the executive president of the party is currently lodged in the Birsa Munda jail in Ranchi.

Notably, the Jharkhand Police had also issued to the ED officials after Soren had filed a case against the agency under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.  Soren had alleged that the ED’s searches at his residences were aimed at tarnishing his image and harassing him for being a tribal. But the Jharkhand High Court ordered no coercive action against ED officials after the agency filed a petition challenging Soren’s FIR.

The ED had claimed to have recovered Rs 36 lakh in cash and documents related to the investigation, alleging that Soren had acquired 8.5 acres of land through fraudulent means. The investigation revealed that a syndicate, including Revenue Sub-Inspector Bhanu Pratap Prasad, was involved in corrupt property acquisitions.

Soren’s petition to attend the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly’s budget session was dismissed by the High Court on February 29. He had resigned as Chief Minister following his arrest in the money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.",,,"Recent discussions in Parliament have highlighted the ongoing tensions between the ruling party and the opposition.

Delhi Rains: One Dead, Several Injured as Roof Collapses at Airport Terminal 1

New Delhi: A roof at Terminal-1D of the Indira Gandhi International Airport collapsed early on Friday morning, killing at least one person – a taxi driver – and injuring several others. Check-in counters at the airport were closed because of safety concerns. There were massive traffic jams around the airport area, and all departing flights until 1 pm have been cancelled.

A roof sheet and some supporting pillars fell on cars and taxis lining up outside the departures lane.

The Fire Service received a call about the collapsed roof at around 5:30 am. Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu has said he is personally monitoring the situation.


Terminal 1 was expanded recently and Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the expanded version on March 11 this year. Opposition leaders hit out at Modi for insisting on inaugurating the terminal during his campaign spree, while it was still “incomplete”.




Kinjarapu responded to “clarify that the building inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi is on the other side and the building that collapsed here is an old building and was opened in 2009″, thereby trying to distance Modi from the tragedy.

Heavy rains late on Thursday night and into Friday night has left Delhi’s streets waterlogged and several residential areas flooded on Friday (June 28) morning.


The traffic police issued advisories because of water-logging on roads and under flyovers.


This rain comes after a long and severe heat wave in the city, which had reportedly led to at least 277 people dying in heat-related incident.

The Indian Meteorological Department said that the Safdarjung area in the city received 154 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Thursday and 5:30 am on Friday. The IMD also told people to “avoid waterlogged areas” and be careful of slippery roads.

","Back in February 2009, the then Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit inaugurated the terminal in question at the Indira Gandhi International Airport while Praful Patel was the Civil Aviation Minister.

On Friday (28th June), a roof collapsed at Terminal-1 of Delhi airport leaving one dead and six injured. Even in a situation like this, the opposition parties found an opportunity to attack the Central government.

Taking to X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that in March this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Terminal-1 of Delhi Airport the roof of which he asserted collapsed today.

“…On March 10th, when Modi ji inaugurated the Delhi Ariport T1, he called himself“Doosri mitti ka insaan…” All this false bravado and rhetoric was only reserved for quickly indulging in ribbon-cutting ceremonies before Elections! Our heartfelt condolences to the victims of the Delhi airport tragedy. They bore the brunt of a Corrupt, Inept and Selfish Govt,” Kharge wrote.


Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also quick to blame PM Modi as she wrote, “Delhi Airport Terminal-1, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in March, suffered a roof collapse today, resulting in the tragic death of a cab driver…This is BJP’s corrupt model of “take donation and give business” which has now been exposed. The question is, will the Chief Inauguration Minister take responsibility for this poor construction work and this corrupt model?”


Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress spokesperson Riju Dutta used the incident to attack PM Modi and claimed that PM Modi hurriedly inaugurated Terminal-1 of Delhi Airport for election campaigning. She alleged that PM Modi is “directly responsible” for the death of three people in the roof collapse.

“Roof collapse in Delhi Terminal 1 Airport departure area. 3 Dead including a cab driver in pillar collapse, at least 6 injuries. Tragedy & national shame. Flights suspended. For election campaigning, PM Modi had hurriedly “inaugurated” T1 in March even while it was under construction. From Jabalpur Airport to Ayodhya Station to now New Delhi Airport, “Photojeevi” PM’s desperation to inaugurate projects before completion for political mileage is the fundamental reason for such tragedies. He’s directly responsible for the death of 3 people who lost their lives because PM Modi was desperate to campaign,” Dutta posted.


Tamil Nadu Congress general secretary Laksmi Ramachandran claimed that the Delhi Airport is not an old one but rather “just inaugurated”. “OMG….Airport roof falling? It is not even an old airport, just inaugurated one! When will we wake up? This is what monopoly leads to….3 lives lost,” she posted.


Was Delhi Airport’s Terminal-1 inaugurated by PM Modi three months ago?
Amidst the political blame game started by the opposition parties, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidr said that the building that collapsed here is an old building and was inaugurated back in 2009.

“…we are taking this incident seriously…I want to clarify that the building inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi is on the other side and the building that collapsed here is an old building and was opened in 2009…” the Minister said.


Notably, back in February 2009, the then Delhi Chief Minister and Congress leader Sheila Dikshit inaugurated the terminal in question at the Indira Gandhi International Airport when Praful Patel was the Civil Aviation Minister.

https://thewire.in/politics/modis-boast-about-giving-70-muslim-obc-groups-reservation-in-gujarat-as-cm-comes-back-to-haunt-him,Modi’s Boast About 'Giving 70 Muslim OBC Groups Reservation in Gujarat as CM' Comes Back to Haunt Him,"Three reasons why BJP’s shrill pitch against Muslim reservations is not only based on untruths but also hypocritical and not politically savvy.

Modi’s Boast About 'Giving 70 Muslim OBC Groups Reservation in Gujarat as CM' Comes Back to Haunt Him

“Among Muslims in Gujarat, there are 70 groups, who are OBC. When I was in Gujarat, they used to get benefits in the OBC category “

– Narendra Modi on February 9, 2022

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been on a hate-speech spree since his outing in Rajasthan’s Banswada, first on “redistribution”, telling those assembled that their “mangalsutras” and few resources “hidden in bajra cans” will be taken away by the Congress and “redistributed” to “Musalmaan” or “those who have more children,” and who are “infiltrators”.


But subsequently, when a distinct impression gained momentum that the BJP wants “400 seats” to scrap reservations, the party has stopped using the slogan and also tried to cap its several leaders from saying they want to change the Constitution. Modi’s speeches too have taken to spreading a different kind of misinformation about the Congress manifesto. He and other top leaders of the BJP are officially saying that the Congress wants to “take away reservation from SC/ST/OBCs” and “give it to Muslims.”

But even this has political costs for the BJP, ruling with a majority for ten years now.

Any hopes that Modi and the BJP had with the talk of “Muslim outreach,” emphasised by the party, particularly focusing on ‘triple talaq’ as a means to dilute Muslim concerns to take away the edge from sections of the population that are determined to oppose the BJP, would have vanished after the spree of open Islamophobia.

But there are three aspects on which the reservation talk on Muslims is backfiring and embarrassing the BJP.

Firstly, Modi himself has been keen to take credit for providing reservation for backward Muslims. In an interview to ANI two years ago, he applauded himself forgiving them benefits. He had said: “Among Muslims in Gujarat, there are 70 groups, who are OBC. When I was in Gujarat, they used to get benefits in the OBC category.” (Watch the video at 28:40). All allegations against the Congress leadership nationally or in states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana fall flat with Congress leaders pointing out to his own comments and claims about ensuring backward Muslims get their due via reservations.

Second, his own allies in the NDA, JD(S)’s H.D. Deve Gowda, were claiming credit for ensuring that Muslim backwards got the reservation benefits due to them when Gowda was chief minister of Karnataka, taking away from Modi trying to paint Karnataka’s Congress dispensation into a corner by portraying them as pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu. But Mysore, the princely state has been a pioneer in introducing reservation towards fair representation and social justice.

“The first ever order for affirmative action was issued in 1874 and it included Muslims.” This followed the first ever census conducted in India in 1872 which “revealed a preponderance of Brahmins in public services, to correct which the first order introducing reservation was introduced in 1874 in Mysore state, restricting it to only the Police Department.” In their present form, reservations for Muslim backwards are at least 20 years old.

When BJP’s Basavaraj Bommai was chief minister of the state, he scrapped the reservation benefits for backward Muslims, till he was ordered by the Supreme Court to reinstate the provision.

On April 25, 2023, Karnataka chief minister Bommai’s counsel told the Supreme Court that the state government will not implement its decision to scrap 4% reservation for Muslims in the 2B category of the ‘Other Backward Castes’ till the hearing in the top court is completed.

BJP’s ally in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu has promised to preserve the 4% reservations to Muslims under the OBC category in Andhra Pradesh, if the TDP-JSP-BJP alliance is elected to power. He did this as recently as on May 2 (Thursday), while addressing a Praja Galam public meeting. Naidu, reports The Hindu, said that advocates would be engaged to get the case resolved in the Supreme Court.

“Interests of the Muslims will be safeguarded by rejuvenating welfare schemes meant for them,” he said.

Third, all talk of ‘Pasmanda’ Muslims, which has been used to drive a wedge in the idea of a consolidated Muslim vote, was important in states like Bihar and particularly pushed there. Dainik Jagran even did an ‘inside story’ on November 23, 2022, on the planning by the BJP to cleave backward Muslim votes off from the Mahagathbandhan for itself. But, now, with this wholesale attack personally by Modi on the idea of reservation for Muslim backwards has further compounded alienation from the BJP. Their votes may not matter or be needed by the BJP, but their political actions do have consequences.

In India, reservations are given, flowing from Article 15(4) and 16(4) for backwardness irrespective of religion.

Subsequently, during Modi's tenure as CM, 14 castes and some sects were appended to the list, none of which pertained to Muslims.
As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections are underway, the Congress trolls on social media are hyperactively spreading fake news and disinformation in the forlorn hope of tipping the scales in favour of their party, whose leaders appear resigned to the fact that Modi’s return to power is all but inevitable. 

In an attempt to reverse the fortunes of the Congress party, its online supporters and trolls have started claiming that Modi granted reservations to Muslim castes during his tenure as Gujarat CM. 

The claims have spawned on social media after PM Modi asserted that Congress tried to grant reservation to Muslims at the expense of SC/ST castes. Addressing the electorate in Rajasthan’s Tonk-Sawai Madhopur Lok Sabha constituency, slated to cast their votes on April 26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remarked on Tuesday that in 2004, the Congress attempted to allocate reservations to Muslims in Andhra Pradesh at the expense of diminishing SC/ST reservations, displaying what he described as a disregard for the Constitution.

“The reality is that during the Congress regime, they sought to carve out a separate reservation for their favoured voting bloc by encroaching upon the reservations meant for Dalits and backward classes. This action, he emphasised, stands in stark contradiction to the principles outlined in the Constitution,” PM Modi said. 

No sooner did Modi accuse Congress of minority appeasement by granting reservations to Muslims by encroaching upon quota meant for SC/ST castes than a raft of Congress trolls online began sharing an incomplete video to insinuate that Modi accorded reservation to Muslim castes during his tenure as the Gujarat CM. 



Congress trolls share an incomplete video of Modi to make misleading claims: Modi doesn’t claim to extend reservations to Muslim castes in the state list
Firstly, in the video, Modi isn’t making such assertions; rather, he mentions that during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, numerous Muslim castes benefited from reservations under the OBC quota. However, he notes that the media often overlooks such instances. Nowhere does Modi claim that his administration included any Muslim caste in the state’s OBC list.

It is indeed a fact that numerous “Muslim castes” have been receiving reservations under OBC quotas across various states for nearly four decades. Muslim castes were also granted reservations in the central OBC quota, with the UPA government issuing notifications to this effect. This practice predates Modi’s tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat.

Curiously, upon examining the castes enumerated in Gujarat’s state OBC list, it becomes apparent that all the Muslim castes that were included in the list were before Narendra Modi assumed office as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Subsequently, during Modi’s tenure as CM, 14 castes and some sects were appended to the list, none of which pertained to Muslims.


Notifications issued by successive Gujarat govts to extend reservations to various caste groups
Modi took the oath of Gujarat CM on 7 October 2001 and was the chief minister of the state till 2014. As per the List of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes declared by Gujarat State, there were 7 instances when the state government intervened to add castes to the existing list.

These include Kamli, Tamboli, Garai, Gurav, Kalal (Hindu), Sanghar (Hindu), Nagarchi, Kayasth, Gandharv (Hindu), Darji, Bhandari, Kathi Rajgir and Ahir Gor, Kuruhin Shetty, and Hajari (Rajput). 


Castes included in reservations under Modi as Gujarat CM
Kalal Muslims were already included in caste reservations; Kalal Hindus were included in reservations under Modi as Gujarat’s CM
Indeed, a noteworthy instance arises with the Kalal caste of Gujarat. While both Hindus and Muslims are recognised as belonging to this caste, only Muslim Kalals were granted reservation and incorporated into the OBC list by the Gujarat government. It wasn’t until 2005, under the Modi administration, that Hindu Kalals were eventually included in the list.

Interestingly, there are 31 Muslim castes granted reservations by the Gujarat government. Out of 31, 29 Muslim castes were granted reservations under the Congress-led governments in the state. There were two instances when Muslim castes were included in the ambit of reservations under BJP-led governments, one in December 1995 and the other one in September 1996, but Modi was not at the helm of the government then.

https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/preaching-consensus-provoking-confrontation/article68343827.ece,"Preaching consensus, provoking confrontation","There is no evidence that the Prime Minister has come to terms with the electoral outcome or has reflected on the message sent to him by voters, writes Sonia Gandhi. On June 4, 2024, the verdict of our country’s electorate was delivered clearly and resoundingly. It signalled a personal, political, and moral defeat for a Prime Minister who had awarded himself a divine status during the campaign. The verdict negated not only such pretensions, but it was also an unequivocal rejection of the politics of divisiveness, discord and hatred, a repudiation of both the substance and style of governance of Mr. Narendra Modi.


The fading of accommodation
Yet, the Prime Minister continues as if nothing has changed. He preaches the value of consensus but continues to value confrontation. There is not the slightest evidence that he has come to terms with the electoral outcome, or understood the verdict and has reflected on the message sent to him by millions of voters. The first few days of the 18th Lok Sabha have sadly been far from encouraging. Any hope that we might see a changed attitude has been dashed. Any hope that a new spirit of mutual respect and accommodation, let alone camaraderie would be fostered, has been belied.

I would like to remind readers what the INDIA bloc parties told the Prime Minister when his emissaries sought unanimity for the post of Speaker. The response was simple and straightforward: we said that we would support the government — but in keeping with convention and tradition, it was only fair and to be expected that the post of Deputy Speaker would be given to a member from the ranks of the Opposition. This perfectly reasonable request was found unacceptable by a regime that, it bears recall, had not filled the Constitutional position of Deputy Speaker in the 17th Lok Sabha.

And then, the Emergency was dredged up by the Prime Minister and his party – astonishingly, even by the Speaker whose position is incompatible with any public political stance other than one of strict impartiality. This attempt to divert attention away from the assault on the Constitution, on its foundational principles and values, on the institutions it has created and empowered, does not augur well for the smooth functioning of Parliament.

It is a fact of history that in March 1977 the people of our country gave a categorical verdict on the Emergency, which was accepted unhesitatingly and unequivocally. That less than three years later the party that was humbled in March 1977 was returned to power, with a majority never achieved by Mr. Modi and his party, is also very much part of that history.

Issues that need extensive debate
We need to look ahead. The bizarre and unprecedented suspension of 146 Members of Parliament, who were legitimately demanding a discussion on a deplorable breach of Parliament’s security, was clearly a way of ensuring that three far-reaching criminal justice laws could be passed without any discussion. Several legal experts and many others have expressed grave concerns about these laws. Should these laws not be kept in abeyance till they have undergone fuller Parliamentary scrutiny in keeping with accepted parliamentary practice and especially since the electoral verdict of 2024? Similarly, amendments to forest conservation and biological diversity protection forest laws were pushed through last year when there was uproar and chaos in Parliament. An ecological and humanitarian disaster is awaiting us as the Great Nicobar project is pushed through. Should they also not be revisited to give meaning to the Prime Minister’s stated desire for consensus and for passage of laws after full debate and discussion?


On the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) scandal that has wreaked havoc on the lives of lakhs of our youth, the immediate response of the Education Minister was to deny the magnitude of what has happened. The Prime Minister who does his ‘Pariksha pe Charcha’ has been conspicuously silent on the leaks that have devastated so many families across the country. The inevitable ‘high power committees’ have been constituted but the real issue is how the professionalism of educational institutions such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training, the University Grants Commission and universities themselves have been so deeply damaged in the last 10 years.

Meanwhile, the campaign of violence and intimidation against India’s minorities has once again intensified. In the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States, bulldozers are again demolishing the homes of minorities based on mere allegations, violating due process, and inflicting collective punishment. None of this is surprising given the communal invective and blatant falsehoods that the Prime Minister inflicted on the people during the election campaign. He provocatively escalated the rhetoric out of fear that the election was slipping away from him, showing complete disregard for the dignity and maryada of his position.

In February 2022, the BJP and its allies got a convincing majority in the assembly elections in Manipur. Yet, within 15 months Manipur began to burn—or should it be said was allowed to begin to burn. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands dislocated. Social harmony in this most sensitive state has been shattered. Yet, the Prime Minister has not found either the time or the inclination to visit the State nor to meet with its political leaders. It is no wonder that his party has lost both the Lok Sabha seats there, but this does not seem to have had any impact on his most insensitive handling of the crisis that has engulfed Manipur’s variegated society.


The Prime Minister diminished himself by the campaign he ran for over forty days. His words did untold damage to our social fabric and to the dignity of the office he is privileged to hold. It is for him to reflect and introspect and recognise that in rejecting his call for 400-plus parliamentary seats, crores of our people – to whom he promises sabka saath, sabka vikas — sent a powerful message, that they had had enough.

The Opposition will reflect India’s voice
The INDIA bloc parties have made it clear that they do not seek a confrontationist attitude. The Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi has offered cooperation. The leaders of the constituents of the alliance have made clear that they are looking to being productive in Parliament and to impartiality in the conduct of its proceedings. It is our hope that the Prime Minister and his government will respond positively. The initial evidence does not augur well, but we in the Opposition are committed to restoring balance and productivity in Parliament, to ensure that the voice of the millions who have sent us there as their representatives is heard and their concerns are raised and addressed. We live in hope that the Treasury benches will step forward so that we can fulfil our democratic duties.",https://zeenews.india.com/video/news/taal-thok-ke-bulldozer-has-your-religion-changed-2761825.html,Taal Thok Ke: 'Bulldozer'.. has your religion changed?,"Taal Thok Ke: Congress Parliamentary Party President and Rajya Sabha MP Sonia Gandhi has strongly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an article.

Comedian Daniel Fernandes on Saturday cancelled a stand-up performance in Telangana’s Hyderabad after receiving threats from a BJP MLA about a joke he had made about the Jain community.

In a clip from a performance he had posted on social media, Fernandes had made a joke about some members of the Jain community who disguised themselves as Muslims to buy goats in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk ahead of the Muslim festival of Bakra Eid.

According to a report by The Print, some members of the Jain community had paid Rs 15 lakh to buy 124 goats to “save” them from being slaughtered.

Within hours of the video being posted, Fernandes’ Instagram post was filled with angry comments. On Friday, he posted a statement on Instagram saying he would remove the joke.

On Saturday, Bharatiya Janata Party leader T Raja Singh from Hyderabad said in a video that if Fernandes did not cancel the show, “our workers will come there and thrash you”.

Singh, the MLA from the Goshamahal constituency, also urged the Hyderabad Police to cancel the comedian’s show. “If not, everyone will remember the state we will make of him so that no one will ever make a joke on the Jain community or Hinduism,” he said.

Fernandes apologised to the Jain community and said that he had received several “abusive and threatening” messages after he initially posted the video.

“As comedians, we are aware that once in a while something we say may not be received well,” he said in a post. “It’s the nature of the business. It’s impossible to make everyone laugh.”

Fernandes said that there was “no malice” involved in his writing process, adding that comedy should bring people together rather than drive them apart.

“My intention with my craft has always been only to entertain, and while lot of my fans have enjoyed this particular video, it is also possible that people may have felt genuinely hurt,” he said.


Later in the day, in a video on social media, he said that the video on the joke had been taken down and an apology had been issued. He added that the show in Hyderabad had to be “rescheduled because of the unrest caused” by the comedy sketch.

“However, we are still receiving calls, messages, and emails threatening us with violence and vandalism,” Fernandes said. “Nobody is ready to guarantee the safety of my audience, my crew and myself. I do not want to put anyone in harm’s way because of something I said.”

He said that it was all right to disagree with the work of an artist. However, to threaten violence was not an answer, the comedian added.

In January, BJP MLA T Raja Singh had been booked by the Maharashtra Police for making incendiary speeches at a rally in Maharashtra’s Solapur district.

During the rally held on January 6, Singh allegedly urged the audience to assault “love jihadis” and boycott products with halal certification.

“Love jihad” is a Hindutva conspiracy theory that Muslim men lure Hindu women into romantic relationships in order to convert them to Islam. The Union home ministry has told Parliament that Indian law has no provision defining “love jihad”.

Comedian Daniel Fernandes, who shot to fame with his controversial comments during a stand-up targeting the Jain community for rescuing goats on Bakrid, got his show Hyderabad show, “Do You Know Who I Am?”, scheduled for 4 PM on Saturday, June 29, cancelled after Goshamahal BJP MLA T Raja Singh warned of dire consequences if he was allowed to perform at Heart Cup Coffee in Jubilee Hills.

Fernandes released a video saying that his show has been ‘rescheduled’ following outrage over his recent video. In the video, he says, “The video that offended people has been taken down, and I have posted an apology. However, we are still receiving threats of violence and vandalism. Nobody can guarantee the safety of my audience, crew, or myself. I don’t want to put anyone in harm’s way because of something I said.”

Fernandes added that while it’s okay to disagree with an artist’s work, threatening violence is not the answer. He also apologized again to the Jain community.

Following outrage over Fernandes’ video ridiculing the Jain community, which was subsequently deleted after massive backlash from the Jains, BJP MLA T Raja Singh released a video warning of dire consequences if he goes ahead with his show scheduled in Banjara Hills.

“Jai Jeenendra, Jai Siya Ram. On Bakri Eid, a comedian named Daniel Fernandes cracked bad jokes and mocked the Jain community. I want to tell him to cancel his Banjara Hill show or else our workers will come there and thrash you. You will think 50 times before coming to Telangana,” Singh said.


Requesting the police to cancel the show, Singh added, “We urge you to call off his show. If not, the state we will make of his will be remembered, so no one will ever joke about Jains or the Hindu religion,” recalling the tensions when comedian Munawar Faruqi was scheduled to perform in Hyderabad in 2022, warning the police that any unrest would be their responsibility.

For those unfamiliar, Daniel Fernandes found himself in controversy over his ‘Jains Buy Goats’ video. After the video went viral, he faced significant backlash for jokes touching on religious sentiments, particularly about the Jain and Muslim communities. In the video, Fernandes joked about Jains being involved in the meat business, leading to criticism for creating tension between the two communities.",,,"Recent discussions in Parliament have highlighted the ongoing tensions between the ruling party and the opposition.

Sharing her ordeal, 60-year-old Indu, widow of Inspector Inderjeet Singh of the Border Security Force (BSF) who was killed during the war — recalls how an Uttar Pradesh (UP)-based officer at a government office in Meerut, driven with lust, had misbehaved with her.

Singh's team of six had cordoned off the area where 40 terrorists were holed up. Eventually, the BSF was able to kill four of those terrorists. During the Kargil War, BSF personnel were deployed in sensitive areas along the LoC to assist the Indian Army battling in Kargil.

""It was a very dangerous operation,"" Indu recalls. Besides Singh, two others lost their lives, including another senior officer and second-in-command Satpal Chaudhary of Yamunanagar.

The Kargil War was fought between India and Pakistan from May to July 1999 in J&K's Kargil district and other areas along the the Line of Control. It officially ended on July 26 that year with Pakistan's defeat.

Indu, originally from Baghpat, UP but now settled in Rohtak city of Haryana, says she was not the only one subjected to such harassment.

Following the officer's inappropriate actions and hearing stories from other war widows about officers' demeaning attitude towards them, Indu says she decided to approach the then Union home minister LK Advani in 2001 to complain against the officer. It was after Advani’s intervention that the officer was suspended.


This wasn't the only incident. Recalling a visit to an LIC office to enquire about her husband's policies, she says an employee ""misbehaved"" with her there too.

“Mine was not an isolated case. Forcing widows to sit close to them, asking them to stay till odd hours and talking with double meaning were common occurrences, which I and others faced during the initial days of widowhood,"" she says.

""I was educated and objected to the act on every occasion, but the majority of young widows, who were illiterate and from rural areas without any exposure to the outside world, were harassed,” says Indu, who is a postgraduate.

It wasn't just this harassment she had to deal with, Indu also faced difficulties at home. She says she was unable to survive in her late husband’s joint family setup in Baghpat where she was pressured for “Rupya” (a custom to get married to a brother of the late husband).

At the time, her two sons Prashant and Bhanu were seven and five, respectively.

Indu refused to follow this custom; instead she told her in-laws and her family that she would live the rest of her life with the memories of her brave husband who had laid down his life for the country.

She then left Baghpat and decided to settle in Rohtak with the help of some relatives there.

As the kin of a martyr, Indu was entitled to allottment a petrol pump as per the government's policy for Kargil widows. After a long struggle that involved her shuttling from the offices of the state government and the Union ministry of home affairs to the Indian Oil Corporation, her battle finally ended in 2007 when she was allotted a pump in Rohtak city.

While visiting these offices, she encountered several officials who considered widows ""easy targets to satisfy their physical lust"". “I witnessed a complete lapse of morality during the initial days of widowhood,” Indu says.

After many years of struggle as a single parent raising two children, Indu says she now has stability in her life. Currently settled in an upscale residential area of Rohtak, Indu runs the petrol pump allotted by the government along with her two sons. She also visits Baghpat every year to perform havan at the native place of her husband.",https://www.opindia.com/2024/06/times-of-india-clickbait-headline-indian-army-sexual-harassment-insinuations-kargil-war-widow-exposed/,"The Times of India insinuates that Indian army officers asked for ‘sexual favours’ from Kargil war widows, changes clickbait headline after outrage","The accusations of sexual harassment levelled by wife of Kargil war martyr Indu Singh were directed towards State government officials and not officers in the Indian army.

On Thursday (27th June), ‘The Times of India’ suggested that Indian army officers had sought sexual favours from the wives of soldiers, who were martyred during the Kargil War of 1999.


The popular Indian English daily made such an insinuation through an article’s clickbait headline, which goes as ‘We Kargil widows “were easy targets for officers to satisfy lust”.’

The cunning choice of words, in the headline, suggested that widows of fallen soldiers of the Kargil War were somehow preyed upon by officers within the Indian army to satisfy their lust.


Screengrab of the controversial headline by The Times of India
However, a thorough reading of the article makes it clear that those who solicited sexual favours from the victims were not army officers but employees at government offices.

According to The Times of India, a 60-year-old woman named Indu Singh faced harassment and unwanted sexual advances at government offices for several years instead of support during crisis.

She is the widow of martyred Border Security Force (BSF) Inspector Inderjeet Singh. Singh informed that a government officer in Meerut, had misbehaved with her, out of lust. The accused had even inappropriately touched her with his feet.

Govt officer suspended after intervention of LK Advani
“The officer was given the task of overseeing land allotment for construction of the memorials of martyrs in their respective villages. She says the officer even touched her with his feet when she was sitting in front of him for some help in connection with the allotment,” the report added.

As per the English daily, the said officer was suspended after Indu Singh approached the then Union Home Minister LK Advani in 2001.

The report by The Times of India added, “Following the officer’s inappropriate actions and hearing stories from other war widows about officers’ demeaning attitude towards them, Indu says she decided to approach the then Union home minister LK Advani in 2001 to complain against the officer. It was after Advani’s intervention that the officer was suspended.”

Not an isolated case: Indu Singh
Indu Singh also narrated another incident where an officer at government-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) misbehaved with her as well.

The sexual advances made by officers at government offices included double meaning talks, forcing widows to sit next to them or making them stay late.

She told the Indian English daily, “I was educated and objected to the act on every occasion, but the majority of young widows, who were illiterate and from rural areas without any exposure to the outside world, were harassed.


According to Indu Singh, the government officers regarded widows as “easy targets”. She told The Times of India, “I witnessed a complete lapse of morality during the initial days of widowhood.”

The Times of India changes headline after outrage
As evident from the content of the article, the accusations of sexual harassment levelled by wife of Kargil war martyr Indu Singh were directed towards State government officials and not officers in the Indian army.

However, The Times of India chose to mislead its readers into believing otherwise especially those who may not have the patience to read the article in its entireity. Following social media outrage, the Indian English daily was forced to change its headline.

“We Kargil widows “were easy targets of govt officers’ unwanted advances”,” the new headline of the article read.


While there is no dearth of clickbait articles in Indian media sphere, it was disappointing to see a prominent English daily resort to misleading tactics to grab eyeballs.

He promises to fulfill Congress manifesto, uplift the poor, and introduce schemes for youth and farmers. INDORE/KHARGONE: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that the party will remove 50% reservation ceiling in govt jobs if it forms the govt, and increase it to a level that ""meets the requirements of tribals, SC/ST, OBC and poor"". ""BJP leaders say they will snatch the rights of reservation from tribals, Dalits, OBCs. We are going to increase the 50% reservation ceiling. The court has set a limit of 50% on reservation that we will do away with and will give tribals, Dalits, OBCs and poor the reservation they require,"" Rahul said at public meetings in Alirajpur's Jobat and Khargone's Segaon town. With a copy of the Constitution in his hand, Rahul said, ""This election aims to save the constitution that BJP and RSS want to change. Congress party and INDIA bloc are trying to save this Constitution, which has given the tribal, Dalit and deprived people of the country their rights including that of Jal, Jungle, Jameen."" ""BJP leaders have made it clear that if they win the election, they will change this book (Constitution) and do away with it.

""The poor, farmers and labourers will get the same amount of money that the PM has given to 22 billionaires,"" he said. He alleged that PM Narendra Modi implemented the ""wrong policies"" of demonetisation and GST to benefit billionaires, and this ruined the cotton industry and small and medium traders of the region. Modi's promise of giving jobs to 2 crore youth was false, the former Congress chief said. ""In the last 10 years, you (the people) have been given unemployment, tribals are migrating out to other states, farmers were not given the price of their crops, women were not helped, but the loan of Rs 16 lakh crore of 22 richest people was waived,"" he said. ""Congress had returned your rights to you by bringing PESA law, land acquisition and tribal bill,"" Rahul added. Rahul reiterated the Congress manifesto promise of giving Rs 1 lakh per year to one woman of every family till they rise above the poverty line. ""We are bringing 'Pehli Naukri Pakki' scheme for young graduates and diploma holders, under which every youth will get training and will also be given Rs 1 lakh per year, and will be given a permanent job on doing good work',"" Rahul said, adding that 30 lakh government posts will be filled if Congress forms the govt. ""Tribals, Dalits and backward people have no participation in the country. We want to change this. We want your people in government, media, public sector, big companies.

Rahul also talked about doubling the income of ASHA and Anganwadi workers and increasing MNREGA wages to Rs 400 per day. ""Narendra Modi started the contract system in public sector and turned youths into bonded labourers.

During his election campaign and after the election results, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been alleging and furthering the unsubstantiated trope against PM Modi-led NDA government that the ‘Constitution is in danger’ and that it wants to do away with the reservations for vulnerable sections of society. The falsehood was amplified by circulating a doctored video of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. As part of his political rhetoric, he has been waving a red and black leather pocket-sized constitution copy to project himself as the saviour of the Dalits (SC), Tribals (ST), and OBC communities, and the one safeguarding their constitutionally enshrined reservations. 


Ironically, while asserting protecting the constitution and reservations, by extension, the Gandhi scion has been flashing a small copy of the constitution that was conceptualized by Supreme Court advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan who has spoken against OBC reservation as well as a complete overhaul of existing reservations. He has been demanding the introduction of a creamy layer in the SC/ST reservation and incorporating a 10% EWS reservation from the existing 50% limit.   

Notably, Lucknow-based Eastern Book Company has secured intellectual property rights for the said red-black leather-bound Constitution copy meaning the book cannot be copied by other publishers. 

One of the directors of the Eastern Book Company, Sumeet Malik told PTI that the idea of printing a court pocket edition came from Supreme Court advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who suggested that they should publish a version that fits easily in the lawyers’ court pockets. 

Now it is pertinent to note that the Supreme Court lawyer Gopal Sankaranarayanan has been speaking against the OBC reservation, particularly the inclusion of dominant communities which “discriminated against SCs and STs”. 

In an interview with a legal portal Law School Policy Review & Kautilya Society, Sankaranarayanan expressed concerns about the increasing demand for reservation by communities who didn’t face historical discrimination. He asserted that the Parliament went ‘beyond’ the balance that the Constitution intended to achieve when it extended reservations beyond the SC/ST category to include the OBC category. He argued that it was wrong to put the accused and victim in the same category noting that some of the OBC communities getting reservations are the ones who discriminated against SCs.  

Elaborating his rationale against OBC reservations, Gopal said, “Unfortunately, I believe that it went beyond that (balance intended by the Constitution) the minute we went beyond SC/ST. When we went into the entire OBC domain, we took the measures of historical discrimination, slowly, a little bit in a direction where groups that were socially fairly strong, and in large numbers, were now getting the benefits that should have gone to those who have historically discriminated. Please remember that a large number of those who are the OBCs were the ones who have discriminated against SCs, now you’re putting them both in the same benefit category effectively.” 

Additionally, he was part of the pleas that were filed in the Supreme Court demanding the introduction of a creamy layer in the SC/ST reservations. Back in 2018, a plea was filed by Samta Andolan Samiti, the umbrella body of general and OBC government employees and nine people belonging to the SC/ST community.

Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan sought the introduction of the creamy layer concept in SC/ST reservations to keep the rich among them out to ensure that the benefits go to the poor and the needy.

The counsel argued that due to the non-application of the concept of creamy layer in SCs and STs, the actually backward and deprived members of the SCs and STs are having a “heart burning” that uplifted/affluent and advanced portion of castes included in SCs and STs are taking away the benefits, which are designed for them.

Last year, he appeared in the Supreme Court to challenge the EWS reservation. Elaborating his opposition to the EWS reservations, he told the legal portal, “I was fine with saying EWS is good, but nuance it by saying that it is limited to 50% and doesn’t allow them to cross the 50% limit.” 

In a glaring irony, while the Supreme Court lawyer has been advocating for limiting reservations to a 50% cap, Rahul Gandhi, who has been declaring his intent to breach this limit and raising slogans such as ‘Jitni Aabadi Utna Haq,’ has been brandishing a copy of the Constitution conceptualized by the former.


Nonetheless, the Constitution copy that I.N.D.I. alliance leaders including Rahul Gandhi have been flashing at everyone roughly measures 20 centimetres in length and nine centimetres in breadth. Its first edition was launched in 2009 and there have been about 16 editions of this book, which have been published so far. The publisher has used Bible paper which is very thin. All the article numbers are in red and the text is in black. EBC publisher Sumeet Malik claims to have sold 5,000 copies in the last three months which is the same number that the publisher sold in 2023.

https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/national/2024/07/01/par60-ls-ldall-rahul.html,Rahul takes 'not Hindus' jibe at BJP says it indulges in violence hate 24x7,"New Delhi, Jul 1 (PTI) Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi launched a no-holds-barred attack on the BJP in the Lok Sabha on Monday, saying the leaders of the ruling party are not Hindus as they engage in ""violence and hate"" round the clock, drawing massive protests from the treasury benches, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing the Congress leader of calling the entire Hindu community violent.
    Gandhi, however, hit back at Modi, saying he was speaking about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and neither the ruling party nor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) nor Modi represents the entire Hindu society.
    Besides Modi, who intervened twice, at least five cabinet ministers also interjected during Gandhi's speech that lasted for about an hour and 40 minutes, with Home Minister Amit Shah demanding his apology for painting the Hindu community as violent.
    ""It is not just one religion that talks about courage. In fact, all our religions talk about courage,"" Gandhi said in his debut speech as the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha that was watched by his mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from the visitors' gallery.
    Gandhi quoted Prophet Mohammad to highlight that the Quran also talks about fearlessness and said when our hands are raised for ""dua"", the ""abhay mudra"" can also be observed in a way.
    Holding up pictures of Lord Shiva, Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ, he referred to Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism and Jainism to underline the importance of fearlessness. He also cited the attributes of Lord Shiva and teachings of Guru Nanak, Jesus Christ, Buddha and Mahavir to state that all religions and great people of the country have said ""daro mat, darao mat (do not be scared, do not scare others)"".
    ""Shivji says daro mat, darao mat, shows the abhay mudra (the right hand held upright with the palm facing outwards), talks about ahimsa, but those who call themselves Hindus indulge in hatred, violence and untruths round the clock,"" Gandhi said, pointing towards the BJP MPs.
    As the treasury-bench members stood up in protest, Gandhi slammed the BJP, saying, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus). It is clearly written in Hinduism that one should stand with the truth and not back down from the truth or be scared of it,"" he said.
    Intervening during his speech, Modi said, ""This issue is very serious. Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a serious issue.""
    Gandhi said he is talking about the BJP and the ruling party is not the sole representative of Hinduism.
    ""Ye theka nahi hai BJP ka,"" he said.
    Shah sought the Congress leader's apology to the House and the country for hurting the feelings of crores of people who take pride in identifying themselves as Hindus.
    He said the ruckus created by the opposition cannot drown the fact that the words -- ""those who call themselves Hindus indulge in violence"" -- were used in the House.
    Shah spoke of the Emergency and 1984 anti-Sikhs riots to hit back at Gandhi, saying he has no right to talk about non-violence when the Congress had spread ""ideological terror"" in the country.
    In a swipe at Gandhi for alleging that ministers do not greet him due to the fear of Modi, the prime minister said democracy and the Constitution have taught him to take the leader of opposition seriously.
    Gandhi accused the BJP of launching ""systematic attacks"" on the Constitution and the fundamental idea of India, noting that millions of people have resisted the ideas proposed by the ruling party.
    ""I was attacked on the orders of Prime Minister Modi and the government. There were 20-plus cases (against me), a two-year jail sentence, (my) house was taken away, 55 hours of interrogation by the ED,"" he said.
    As Gandhi held up a picture of Lord Shiva, Speaker Om Birla reminded him that rules do not allow displaying placards in the House.
    The Congress leader also accused the BJP of threatening minorities and spreading hatred and violence against Muslims, Sikhs and Christians.
    He said minorities represent India in all spheres and bring pride to the nation. ""They stand like a rock with the country and are patriots, but you (BJP) attack them,"" he said.
    Referring to the Agnipath scheme for short-term military recruitment, Gandhi said the government regards the Agniveers as ""use-and-throw labourers"" and does not even give them the status of a ""shaheed"" (martyr).
    Defence Minister Rajnath Singh intervened to rebut Gandhi's charge and said an Agniveer who lays down his life in the line of duty gets a compensation of Rs 1 crore.
    ""This House is not for spreading lies. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the House, to the country and to Agniveers,"" Shah said.
    Gandhi claimed that the armed forces know that Agnipath was Modi's brainchild, prompting Singh to accuse the leader of opposition of misleading the House.
    ""If we come to power, we will scrap the Agnipath scheme as it is against jawans, the armed forces and deshbhakts (patriots),"" Gandhi said.
    He also hit out at the Centre over the situation in Manipur, alleging that it has pushed the northeastern state into a civil war.
    The former Congress chief also slammed the government over farmers' issues, saying it did not want to give a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for crops.
    Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan objected to Gandhi's remarks and accused him of ""misleading"" the House. Union ministers Kiren Rijiju and Bhupender Yadav also intervened at different points of Gandhi's speech.
    Later, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, along with Rijiju and BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi, held a press conference to rebut Gandhi's allegations.
    Referring to a row involving medical entrance exam NEET, Gandhi said students do not believe in the exam because they feel that it is for the rich people and there is no place in it for meritorious students.
    Talking about his new role as the leader of opposition, Gandhi said his job is to represent all parties equally with love and affection.
    ""So when Hemant Soren or (Arvind) Kejriwal goes to jail, I should be concerned. When you unleash enforcement agencies on them, we should defend them. When you are a constitutional person, your personal aspirations should take a back seat,"" he said.
    In his concluding remarks, Gandhi asked the ruling party not to spread fear or hatred in the minds of people.
    ""Do not think of the opposition as your enemies. We are ready to discuss any issue that you bring before us. I congratulate you for winning 240 seats,"" he said",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/as-rahul-gandhi-equates-hinduism-ahimsa-in-lok-sabha-hindus-must-not-fall-for-another-gandhi/,"As Rahul Gandhi equates Hinduism with Ahimsa, time to remember why Hindus must not fall for ‘another Gandhi’","Ahimsa, essentially, is doing everything to stop Himsa. Ahimsa is not the absence of Himsa, but the use of Sam, Dam, Danda, Bhed to achieve peace. We could see Rahul Gandhi's speech today in the parliament as just another Hinduphobic rant. Or we could see it for what it was - an attempt to keep the Hindu community ashamed and guilty. India has suffered the consequences of the apotheosis of one Gandhi - we certainly cannot afford another blunder.

Calling it as one sees it is a burden that some bear. While it is often branded a virtue, for me, it has been a physiological reflex, often, much to my detriment. It is almost as if I am simply incapable of shutting up, even when shutting up would certainly have its rewards. One subject that I have, yet again, refused to shut up about and invited the anger of many fellow Hindus, is the merciless defanging of the Hindu community by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

I genuinely and truly believe that the bane of the Hindu community was internalising the lessons of misplaced Ahimsa, predominantly spoon-fed by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi – a man who was ‘christened’, quite literally, as a messiah. The internalised guilt inflicted on the community even when it wanted to defend itself crippled us for generations and to date, we pay the price for trading our right to survival for brotherhood – a sentiment that is delicately nursed by carefully inculcated delusions.

I have, of course, been conferred with several not-so-flattering titles for the views I hold on the issue. In fact, I have often had arguments with my colleague Rahul Roushan on the subject as well. While I believe MK Gandhi was the Hindu community’s undoing, Rahul seems to be far more forgiving. He has repeatedly asserted that he forgives MK Gandhi for his shenanigans because he was a practicing Hindu and was not Hinduphobic – like Nehru, for example. While I insist that MK Gandhi and the ideals he professed must be torn down and dethroned, Rahul believes that Hindus gain nothing by demonising Gandhi and is willing to let him have the throne along with others who perhaps deserve the pedestal.

I had just about moved on from MK Gandhi and started to shift my focus to Dr BR Ambedkar when I heard another ‘Gandhi’ trying the same tricks that MK Gandhi employed, only in a far more sinister manner.

Rahul Gandhi in the parliament said, “Modi ji said once that India has never attacked any other country. There is a reason for that. Because this country is a country of Ahimsa (non-violence), this country is not a country of fear. So all our great personalities spoke about Ahimsa, spoke about removing fear… daro mat, darao mat… and on the other hand, Shiv ji says daro mat, darao mat, shows the Abhay Mudra, talks about Ahimsa and buries his Trishul on the ground. And the people who call themselves Hindus talk about violence, hate and lies 24 hours. You are not a Hindu. In Hinduism, it is clearly mentioned that one should stand with the truth…”. After this, Rahul Gandhi randomly held out his hand to show the Abhay Mudra (essentially, claiming that it was the Congress hand symbol).

Now, we know this rant by Rahul Gandhi is insidious. We know it is sinister. But my reaction to Rahul Gandhi’s rant this time was far more circumspect. I found myself not dismissing him as a blithering fool, but instead, trying to put his speech in context – historical and contemporary.

For those who support PM Modi politically, their immediate reaction would be to say that Rahul Gandhi insulted the entire Hindu community by claiming that Hindus only talk about violence and hate. Of course, this is the simplest interpretation of what he said. I, however, believe there is more to it.

There are two specific components to what Rahul Gandhi said in the parliament. First, Hinduism’s core tenet is that of non-violence. The other is that Modi does not represent all Hindus – this he said after PM Modi made a rare intervention saying that Rahul Gandhi’s characterisation of all Hindus as a people who espouse violence is a serious matter.

Both these components were meant to specifically cater to disgruntled Modi supporters and the young voter – who is fed the “Sabarmati ke sant” delusion as a matter of state policy. As for the second component, I believe it is meant to specifically cater to the ‘disgruntled Hindu voter’ – a segment that has started to look beyond PM Modi for a resolution to Hindu issues. This disgruntled voter believes that the political support base has started hyphenating PM Modi and Hindu issues, often sacrificing the latter for the interest of the former. For both these segments, it is essential to see through the sinister, British-esque designs of Rahul Gandhi.

Ahimsa – a central tenet of Hinduism?
One of the first instances when Hindus were defanged by the British was with the passage of The Indian Arms Act 1878. Right after the revolt of 1857, the British, petrified of another armed resistance to their occupations, passed a law that barred Indians from carrying firearms without a license. The British understood that their best chance to continue their occupation of Bharat was through the de-arming and de-fanging of Hindus.

The de-arming and neutering of Hindus to ensure minimum resistance to their own subjugation became a template – followed not only by the British and MK Gandhi but continued to this day by the party created by the British – the Congress party.

Rahul Gandhi, quite confidently, spoke about Ahimsa being the central tenet of Sanatan Dharma – as if those who pick up weapons to defend themselves and/or the community are committing a cardinal sin. One can’t possibly blame him for his narrow view of Sanatan Dharma, given his Christian mother must have imparted the hollow punchlines that come with religious moral science lectures in Catholic schools as the gospel truth – at least theoretically, which is never followed by the faithful but prove as a great tool for religious brainwashing by inculcating a false sense of moral superiority. Sanatan Dharma has an illustrious history and the Kshatra tradition which revolves around the destruction of evil and is far from the neutered, comatose version of Hinduism that Congress wants to peddle for their own political gains.


One of the primary root words of Kshatra is ‘himsayam’ which relates to the Kshatra’s duty to destroy evil. The etymological explanation of the word Kshatra is, in itself, “one who protects from harm and injury”, the fundamental quality of the Kshatra being to protect Dharma and therefore, the Kshatra-guna itself is related to protection – by force – if necessary.

The pacifists, who follow the path shown by MK Gandhi, often feel squeamish because they believe the Kshatra-guna relates to the promotion of violence, however, that is, again, only a result of the historical brainwashing – a political project to knock Hindus down and keep them there so the pliable community can accept their own subjugation without putting up a fight.

It is, therefore, said that “without the element of protection, Matsya-Nyaya (big fish eat little fish) would prevail”. It is the eternal Sanatan wisdom that says that if there has to be order, there has to be punishment and only if there is punishment, will order emerge. Kamandakiya–Nitisara, in fact, opens with the praise of the King who holds the sceptre to mete out punishment to maintain order.

In the book Ksattra, the authors write, “Among the Vedas, the Rig-veda has been associated with Brahmanas, Yajur-veda with Kṣattriyas, and Sama-veda with Vaisyas. The Yajur-veda has been hailed as an action-oriented, ritual-intensive Veda; while Rig-veda is more aligned to prayer, Sama-veda is aligned to worship, and Atharva-veda forms a bridge between the physical and the spiritual.

Yajur-veda is a symbol of kṣättra, of the protection of the good, and of destruction of enemies. The upa-veda associated with Yajur-veda is Artha-Veda (or Dhanur-veda). While explaining a mantra, the commentator Mahīdāsa says, “Dhanur-veda (archery) is the science of war.”

Through the Dhanur-veda we see the entire system of war. Yajñas like Rajasuya, Sautramani, Vajapeya, and Aśva- medha that are described in the Yajur-veda are famous as kṣāttra-yajñas. The Vajapeya-Yaga is for preparing various units of the army in order to reclaim lost land. The Sautrāmani-Yaga is for bringing allies together. The Rajasuya-yaga is conducted when an emperor is born or created. The Aśva-medha is for expanding the kingdom and establishing sovereign status over a large portion of land. We see unbridled kṣättra in all these yajñas.

There are elements of kṣättra even in the traditional practices related to worship and invoking the Supreme. The unfortunate situation today is that a worship of cowardice has entered military science. We have infused our military with a narrow, ritualistic mindset, thus sapping bravery and energy. However, our Vedic rşis brought an element of kṣättra even in worship and ritual”.

It is, therefore, evident that Sanatan has a strong, illustrious tradition of Kshatra – where force and punishment are used to restore Dharma, protect the weak, and defend the ideals we hold dear. Nowhere in the Yajur-Veda, or any Veda, is Ahimsa in its bastardized, Gandhi version mentioned – it is only an illusion, a grand lie, sold to Hindus to ensure they remain guilty, neutered, and defenceless.

What betrays the Janeudhari version of himself which Rahul Gandhi projects, is his absolute infantile interpretation of Shiva. To allude that Mahadev buried his Trishul because he believed in Gandhi’s Ahimsa is not just infantile but asinine. Mahadev, is quite literally, the God of Destruction and anyone who is a practicing Hindu would certainly not propagate that he destroys with Ahimsa. The Shivlinga itself is a manifestation of Raudra. His Avatars, like Kaal Bhairav, represent the annihilation of time and preservation of the universe – a symbol of fearlessness, the guardian of Temples, the destroyer of enemies and evil spirits. Of course, there is spiritual symbolism of the Trishul which represents the Nadis, levels of consciousness, and more, however, Rahul Gandhi’s reductionist interpretation of Shiva and his Trishul to talk about some binary of Gandhi-esque pacifism is so outlandish that one has to wonder how someone so oblivious of Sanatan Dharma can even have the confidence to talk about the tenets of the faith. In his supreme confidence, which is, unfortunately, the hallmark of the unlettered, Rahul Gandhi wanted to present Sanatan Dharma as some sort of a hippy cult where its participants are high on some form of hallucinogens, lying around in their comatose stupor, talking about universal peace. In reality, Sanatan has a long tradition of Akharas where community defence was one of the fulcrums of collective survival.

Yes, Sanatan Dharma guides every shade and stage of existence. From prosperity to happiness, satisfaction, love, peace – inner and community, punya, karma, moksha, and more – however – it does not look down upon self and community defence, it does not glamourise pacifism and cowardice – in fact – it draws lessons from wars fought for the preservation of Dharma and honour.

Non-violence: An age-old political project to keep Hindus neutered and subjugated
I believe the very existence of the Hindu community hinges on one simple question – Do we wish to emulate MK Gandhi or Gopal Patha – in the face of aggression and violence?

In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. 

On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionizing Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. 

What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off, and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against. 

During the Direct Action Day, on the 17th of August after 2 days of Hindus being massacred, Gopal Chandra Mukhopadhyay rose like a phoenix. Gopal Patha (Patha means ‘lamb’. He was called so because he ran a mutton shop) had already founded the Bharat Jatiya Bahini, an organization of young men to help fellow citizens during a natural calamity. On the 17th, Gopal Patha turned from a philanthropist to a warrior, ready to defend his people. Throughout the night, Gopal Patha, along with his young men from the Bharat Jayati Bahini worked on a plan on how they could defend Hindus from the Muslim barbarians. The Marwaris offered finances, others spent the night making weapons for them. 

Muslim League chief minister of Bengal, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and the Muslim League goons had decided on the 17th that they were going to take two more days to complete the annihilation of Hindus. But they had not taken into consideration their greatest roadblock. Gopal Patha. 

From the 18th to the 20th, Gopal Patha and his men put up a brave fight, paying the Muslim League goons back in equal measure, if not more. Historian Sandip Bandopadhyay wrote, “They faced resistance everywhere. Hindu youths counter-attacked with such ferocity that the Muslim League men had to flee. Many were killed. Emboldened by their success in taking on and defeating their Islamist attackers, Hindu youths took the fight to Muslim-majority areas and started killing Islamist men. They did not, however, touch Muslim women and children or the aged and the infirm”.

During the Noakhali riots, countless Hindus were raped and murdered. The converted Hindus were made to write declarations that they had accepted Islam out of their free will and Hindus in the 2000 square mile area were made to pay the Jaziya. When MK Gandhi visited Naokhali, he was rebuked by the Muslim League and after that, he travelled to Bihar to stop the retaliatory violence by the Hindus. There, he is famed to have said that Hindus must leave Noakhali or die – this, because the Muslim League had asked him to quell the violence, the same Muslim League that was raping Hindu women, beheading Hindu women, and waging a war against Kaffirs. 

MK Gandhi famously asked Gopal Patha to lay his weapons down and surrender. Gopal Patha refused. He refused to give into Gandhi’s pacifism to appease the murderous Jihadis. He refused to give into the delusion that surrendering, being cowardly, and dying with a smile on his face was a virtue. Gopal Patha upheld the tenets of Sanatan Dharma – he preserved Dharma. He protected Dharma. He protected Hindus. He did not give up.

In fact, while MK Gandhi wanted Gopal Patha to lay down his weapons, in the same year in a prayer meeting, he advised the women in East Bengal to commit suicide by poison or some other means to avoid dishonour. He told the women to suffocate themselves or to bite their tongues to end their lives.

In 1921, while the Malabar Muslims were slaughtering Hindus, raping women and forcefully converting Hindus, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi insisted that they had committed a sin against the “Khilafat movement” and not the Hindus. In fact, he went ahead and insisted that Hindus must remain “non-violent” in the face of “extreme provocation”.

While Hindus and Sikhs were being massacred and raped in Pakistan right after the partition, MK Gandhi said, “Hindus and Sikhs should become brave and show that even if all the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan were to be killed there would be no retaliation in India. I do not want to live to see our people copy Pakistan. If I am to live I shall ask every Hindu and every Sikh not to touch a single Muslim. It is cowardice to kill Muslims and we must become brave and not cowards”.

On April 6, 1947, Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi said– “If Muslims want to kill us (Hindus), we must face death bravely. Hindus should not harbour anger in their hearts against Muslims even if the latter wanted to destroy them. If they established their rule after killing Hindus we would be ushering in a new world by sacrificing our (Hindu) lives”. 

There was, indeed, a running theme in what Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi told Hindus. He repeatedly told Hindus that their faith taught them to surrender to evil, murderous mobs who were raping, beheading, murdering, and dishonouring them. He repeatedly told Hindus that his pacifism was a manifestation of the very essence of Sanatan Dharma and if Hindus so much as dared to defend themselves, they would be going against the tenets of their faith.

MK Gandhi told Hindus that cowardice was in fact bravery and bravery was betrayal. He truly and genuinely wanted Hindus to believe that by being cowardly and surrendering to evil unquestioningly, Hindus would be doing the greatest service to this land with Hindu consciousness because that is what Hinduism stood for.

This glorification of cowardice as a virtue, only for Hindus, was diligently furthered as a political project. It was, and still is, accepted wisdom that as long as Hindus are kept under the spell of Ahimsa, the community would give up their bargaining power with the state. For the ultimate retention of political power, it is no secret that the most violent, the most demanding, and the most petulant community has to be kept in good humour. When they get offended, and go on a murderous rampage after Hindus respond with Rangeela Rasool to books insulting Hindus, they need to be kept in good humour by the passage of a special law. When they want to establish a Caliphate in Turkey, they need to be pacified with unquestioning surrender by the Hindu community, willing to be beheaded with a smile on their face.

Rahul Gandhi today did exactly what the political class has done for centuries – twist Sanatan Dharma to convince Hindus that their cowardice is considered a virtue and if they are TRUE Hindus, they would surrender, give in – and die with a smile on their face. It is this political project that leads to the demonisation of Hindutva, the vilification of Raudra Hanuman, the angst at Bhagwan Ram with a bow and arrow, the screaming, screeching uproar at the Ayodhya movement, the aversion to the Ram Temple, the anger at the demystification of history and the unadulterated hate against Hindu organizations – all of it remind Hindus that they are a warrior race, not a herd of sheep who should be led to their slaughter.

Ahimsa, essentially, is doing everything to stop Himsa. Ahimsa is not the absence of Himsa, but the use of Sam, Dam, Danda, and Bhed to achieve peace.

We could see Rahul Gandhi’s speech today in the parliament as just another Hinduphobic rant. Or we could see it for what it was – an attempt to keep the Hindu community ashamed and guilty. India has suffered the consequences of the apotheosis of one Gandhi – we certainly cannot afford another blunder.

He said that the Opposition has remained calm, following god's 'abhay mudra', even after so many attacks by the government. Rahul Gandhi said all religions talk about courage and cited Islam, Sikhism to underline one should be fearless. He attacked BJP in Lok Sabha, saying Hinduism is not about spreading fear, hatred and falsehoods. Objecting to the claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""calling entire Hindu society violent is a serious issue."" Union home minister Amit Shah and other NDA MPs also protested against Rahul's claim and said that he must apologise for his statement on Hinduism. However, Rahul reverted to the objection saying ""BJP, Modi are not entire Hindu society.""

'I was attacked by PM Modi' Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister, Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi further said that he was attacked on the orders of government and PM Modi.

There is no mention of idol worship in Islam, nor is there any kind of mudra. I refute it, there is no mention of 'Abhaya Mudra' in Islam and I believe that Rahul Gandhi should correct his statement,"" Chishty said.

Syed Naseruddin Chishty, Chairman of All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, refuted controversial remarks made by Rahul Gandhi in the parliament on Monday. The Gandhi scion had tried to link ‘Abhaya Mudra’ seen in the images of Hindu gods and goddesses to the election symbol of his party and to all other religions, including Islam, which forbids idol-worshipping.

“Islam also says darna nahin hai (don’t be scared). When prayers are done in Islam, abhay-mudra is seen in both hands,” Gandhi said.

However, Gandhi’s comments did not sit well with Syed Naseruddin Chisty, who denounced his claims saying, “While speaking in the Parliament today, Rahul Gandhi has said ‘Abhaya Mudra’ is also there in Islam. There is no mention of idol worship in Islam, nor is there any kind of mudra. I refute it, there is no mention of ‘Abhaya Mudra’ in Islam and I believe that Rahul Gandhi should correct his statement.”


Rahul’s perverse attempt to link all religions to the Congress party’s symbol and forge a faux unity among different sections of society comes after months of divisive political campaigning, which included promising a caste census and redistribution of wealth based on population to exploit the existing faultlines, especially among the Hindu society where caste still holds dominance.

Gandhi’s disdain for the Hindu community was evident earlier today when he made a controversial remark that spurred a rare intervention from PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, both of whom corrected the Gandhi scion for his sweeping proclamation that those who call themselves Hindus indulge in violence all the time.

During his speech, Rahul Gandhi, said, “All our great men have spoken about non-violence and eliminating fear… But those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth…”

PM Modi raised serious objection to Rahul Gandhi’s comments saying, “Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.”

Following a heated exchange between the Opposition and the ruling NDA’s MPs, Union Minister Amit Shah called for an apology from Rahul Gandhi.

Union Minister Amit Shah criticised Rahul Gandhi’s comment, insisting on an apology.

“The Leader of the Opposition has clearly stated that those who identify as Hindu speak of and commit violence. He is unaware that millions proudly call themselves Hindu. Associating violence with any religion is wrong. He should apologize,” he stated.

Mr. Gandhi, however, retorted that he was speaking about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) or Mr. Modi are not the entire Hindu society, he added.

The Congress leader held up a picture of Lord Shiva and said his message is about fearlessness and non-violence. He also cited the teachings of other religions to make a similar point.

""All religions and all our great men talk about non-violence and fearlessness, but those who call themselves Hindus only talk about violence, hatred and falsehood.... Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus),"" he said.

Mr. Gandhi's dig at the BJP had the members of the treasury benches on their feet.

Home Minister Amit Shah sought the Congress leader's apology to the House and the country for hurting the feelings of crores of people who take pride in identifying themselves as Hindus.

Mr. Shah spoke of the Emergency and 1984 anti-Sikhs riots to hit back at Mr. Gandhi, saying he had no right to talk about non-violence when the Congress had spread ""terror"" in the country.

Mr. Gandhi further emphasised that all religions talk about courage, citing Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism to underline the importance of fearlessness.

He accused the BJP of launching systematic attacks on the Constitution and the fundamental idea of India, noting that millions of people have resisted the ideas proposed by the ruling party.

""I was attacked on the orders of Prime Minister Modi. There were 20-plus cases (against me), (my) house was taken away, 55 hours of interrogation by the ED,"" Mr. Gandhi said.

Despite these challenges, he said he feels proud of the collective effort to protect the Constitution.

“Those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth,” Gandhi was quoted as saying. To this, PM Modi raised serious objection to Rahul Gandhi’s comments saying, “Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.”


Gandhi also showed Lord Shiva’s picture in the House after he attacked BJP saying Hinduism is not about spreading fear, hatred, and falsehoods. Further, he displayed placards featuring images of Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ. He was also carrying a placard featuring a quote from the Quran. “All our great men have spoken about non-violence and ending fear. But, those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, and untruth,” Gandhi said, adding, “Aap Hindu ho hi nahi.” (You are not a Hindu).


India Today
Union Minister Amit Shah meanwhile criticized Rahul Gandhi’s comment, insisting on an apology. “The Leader of the Opposition has clearly stated that those who identify as Hindu speak of and commit violence. He is unaware that millions proudly call themselves Hindu. Associating violence with any religion is wrong. He should apologize,” he stated.

Gandhi is known for making anti-India and anti-Hindu statements. However, this time he attempted to enrage the entire Hindu community by calling them violent. Gandhi seems to have selectively forgotten that several incidents have appeared in the recent past that have been committed by the Muslim community. It is the Islamists who deliberately target the Hindu community and harass them for belonging to a particular religion. Here are some of the instances reported from last week where Hindus have been deliberately targeted by the Islamists.

Muslim students assault 4 Hindus for celebrating T20 World Cup win in Nanded, Maharashtra

Madrasa teacher, Abdul Rahman, earns triple life sentence for sexually assaulting minor girl student in Kerala
A fast-track court in Kerala’s Tirur convicted a Madrasa teacher, Abdur Rahiman (51), for sexually assaulting a minor girl who was under the age of seven at the time of the crime. Following the conviction, the court sentenced him to triple life imprisonment till the end of his life, 15 years imprisonment in various departments. The court also imposed a fine on the convicted Madrasa teacher and asked him to pay Rs 1.5 lakh. He will have to undergo an additional two years in prison, in case he fails to pay the fine. According to local media reports, it is enough to suffer the punishment together.


The convicted Madrassa teacher, Abdur Rahiman (51) was sentenced in Cheruparambi in southern Kuttur. The Tirur Police had registered a case against Abdur Rahiman on charges of sexually assaulting a student in a classroom in the Tirur area in April and May 2016. 


Sharia in West Bengal?
On 30th June, a video shared by CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim went viral over the internet in which a local Bahubali leader could be seen assaulting a married woman and a man. The duo could be seen lying helplessly on the road in the name of ‘summary Justice’. Sharing the video of the assault, CPI(M) leader and Former Rajya Sabha MP Salim alleged that the main accused seen in the video was a local TMC goon who goes by the nickname ‘JCB’. According to him, the local goon runs a Kangaroo court where he allegedly serves summary trial and punishment like the Taliban.

As the video was shared by the BJP leaders or supporters, the West Bengal police ruled by the I.N.D.I.Alliance associate TMC sent notices to the formers asking them to take the posts down. Several journalists BJP leaders and also advocates were served notices. Taking to X, Bhandari informed about the same and wrote, “Action against criminals: No. Action against journalists reporting the crime: Yes. Welcome to West Bengal!”


Supreme Court lawyer Shashank Shekhar Jha questioned if the West Bengal police has no shame left that they are asking X to delete his post wherein he talked about the incident in question. “What Bengal thinks today, India will think tomorrow. Bengal is thinking Sharia today,” Jha’s post stated.

X user Rishi Bagree said that a case against him for quoting a video of the Chopra incident shared by a CPIM leader. He called the Bengal Police’s action as “real dictatorship”.

“West Bengal Police filed a case against me for quoting a video of Md Salim, CPIM leader. Instead of taking action against the culprit they are busy shooting the messengers. This is how real dictatorship looks like,” Bagree posted.


It is important to note that the Congress party has always used Muslims and favored them as they assisted them in the elections by becoming a strong vote bank. This was evident in the recently happened Lok Sabha elections where Muslims in various places issued fatwas to vote in favor of INC.

Rahul Gandhi also has always extended support to Muslims and Islamists calling them secular. Last year in Washington he had made a statement calling the Muslim League, an off-shoot of Jinnah’s party as ‘completely secular’.

Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), which claims to have been born after Indian Independence in 1948, is an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML). The All India Muslim League was succeeded by the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Indian Union Muslim League in India. On its website, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims that its motto is secularism and communal harmony but has often openly indulged in carrying out those objectives which are contrary to its own motto. The Indian Union Muslim League has been notoriously known for flaring up communal incidents. The party was found involved in the planning as well as the execution of the brutal Marad massacre in Kerala in 2003 as per the report of Justice Thomas P Joseph Commission which was set up to investigate the incident.

Interestingly, Rahul Gandhi had called the Muslim League ‘secular’ in response to a question that said he criticized the BJP for being a “Hindu party” and divisive. Rahul is said to have lambasted the Centre on Monday for a ‘full-scale assault on the notion of India and the Constitution, as well as on those who opposed the attack on the Constitution.’ The remarks have however been condemned by BJP leaders, demanding an apology from Gandhi.

Angered by the performance of Muslim men in a cricket tournament, Hindu locals of a Gujarat village on June 22 beat a Muslim spectator at a match to death, The Quint has reported.

Twenty-three year-old Salman Vohra was a resident of Polson compound in Gujarat’s Anand and worked in the garment business. A cricket fan, Vohra had gone to watch a match at Chikhodra, his uncle Noman Anwar Vohra told the news outlet. There had been tension in the atmosphere over pro-Hindutva residents’ opposition to Muslim players doing well in the tournament.

“When they were playing, a section of the crowd began shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’,” an activist, Aasim Khedawala, told Quint.

The match drew a crowd of 5,000 people but Muslims were not more than 500 in number. A drunk man picked a fight with Vohra over where his motorcycle was parked.

“The one who was drunk mistook another Muslim man, Suhail to be Salman [Vohra] and began attacking him. In order to save Suhail from these men, Salman jumped in and the mob surrounded him,” the report said.

A crowd reportedly gathered and chanted in favour of hitting Vohra. His uncle noted that the attackers almost bit his ear off, that a knife wound had damaged his kidney and beaten on his lower waist and neck. He was taken to a hospital for treatment and then referred to a bigger one. He succumbed to his injuries at the second hospital.

Vohra’s wife Mashira is a few weeks pregnant.

Two other Muslim men were also grievously injured, one had to receive 17 stitches and the other, around seven. Maktoob Media has noted that this is the sixth such lynching since June 4.

The family filed a first information report at 4 am on June 23 at the Anand Rural police station.

Nine people have been arrested. They are Mehul Dinesh Parmar, Kiran Mafat Parmar, Mahendra Ramesh Vaghela, Ketan Mahendra Patel, Akshay Narsinh Parmar,Ratilala Raising Parmar, Vijay Mangal Parmar, Mukesh Rajesh Parmar, Rakesh Babu Parmar, Vijay Chhagan Parmarand Ketan Bharat Parmar.

People who spoke to The Quint said that two of the main men who beat him up have not been arrested yet. Hyderabad member of parliament Asaduddin Owaisi has posted on X the claim that “[s]ome members of the Kshatriya community are reportedly pressurising the police to remove the name of Shakti Singh from the list of accused. He is also a relative of a BJP MLA…”.

Following the incident, Police arrested 9 accused, presented them before the court, and got their remand. However, left-wing portals including The Wire, Quint, Maktoob Media, and The Kashmiriyat gave a communal angle to the whole incident and tried to spread animosity between the two communities. 

Notably, the incident took place on 22nd June 2024. The deceased was identified as Salman Whora. He arrived there to watch the cricket tournament which was being played at Chikhodara, late in the evening. 


Meanwhile, a person named Imroz Abdul Rahim got into an argument with the accused. Soon, the argument over the issue of bike parking turned into a fistfight. During this time, the deceased Salman Muhammad Hanif Whora intervened to defend Imroz. It is alleged that the accused assaulted them with a bat and other sharp weapons. Afterward, both of them were shifted to a hospital for treatment. However, 23-year-old Salman died during treatment.

Based on Imroz’s complaint, the police have so far arrested 9 people – 7 accused were initially arrested and 2 were later – and 2 accused are said to be absconding. The Police are carrying out a search operation to nab them. After their demand was over, the police produced them again before the court.

In this matter, the Police have registered a case against the accused under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 302, 324, 323, 504, and 506(2) of the IPC and Section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act.

Leftist media gives the parking dispute incident a communal colour
However, in its reportage, leftist media including The Wire, The Quint, Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat, and some other portals tried to paint this whole incident in a communal colour. They alleged that Hindutva supporters were angry at Muslims who were playing well and they killed a Muslim man. They further alleged that Hindus gathered in the crowd and were chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans during the match. They went further to allege that at the time of the incident, Hindus in the crowd were inciting the killers. 

Media claim completely wrong: DySP Panchal
OpIndia tried to find out the truth about the entire incident and first contacted Anand district DySP Jayesh Panchal. During the conversation, OpIndia asked the Deputy SP about the claims being made in the media reports. 

Responding to the query, he said, “The kind of communal angle that the media is talking about is completely wrong. Police are continuously investigating after the incident. We have interrogated the arrested accused, they also did not say any such thing, the statements of the people present in the field during the incident have also been taken. Even the eyewitnesses have not recorded anything like this in the statement.”

During the conversation, he further stated, “Not only this, the person who is the complainant in the incident has also not mentioned any such incident in his complaint.” 


When OpIndia asked him about the slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” and the claims about the Hindu crowd during the cricket match, he outrightly denied it. 

He said, “In the investigation so far, no incident of this kind has come to our notice, either in the statement of the complainant, the witness, or the accused. ” 

He noted that there was a clash over a motorcycle and added that the claims made in the media were false.


The incident does not have a communal angle: a local Muslim leader
After the conversation with the DySP, OpIndia spoke to Ismailbhai, a local Muslim leader. He told OpIndia, “The slogans raised during the match have nothing to do with the murder. There is no communal angle in this whole incident. What has happened is very wrong. The deceased was recently married. The assailants hit him in the kidney and seriously injured him. All we want is that those who are responsible should be severely punished.” 

When OpIndia asked him about the religious angle in the murder, he said, “Look, the incident is very bad and serious. But let’s not be wrong, there is no communal element in this. The angle does not appear.”

After speaking to Ismailbhai, OpIndia spoke to another local. On condition of anonymity, he said, “People from both parties were present on the ground at the time of the incident. Cricket matches are always held here, but nothing like this has ever happened. People who are saying this is a matter between two communities are totally wrong. Everyone lives in harmony here. The whole tussle was about the parking of a bike. The police have arrested the accused and the matter is now in court. Hope the court will do justice and punish the accused severely.”

",,,"Recent discussions in Parliament have highlighted the ongoing tensions between the ruling party and the opposition. The BJP has reiterated its stance on various issues, including historical events like the Emergency, emphasizing the need to remember and learn from the past to safeguard democratic values. On the other hand, Congress has focused on current challenges, such as the violence in Manipur, urging the government to address the immediate concerns affecting the nation.

    Both sides present compelling arguments, with the BJP calling for a reflection on history to ensure the protection of democracy, while Congress insists on the urgency of addressing present-day issues. The debates in Parliament reflect the complex balance between acknowledging historical events and dealing with contemporary problems, as both sides strive to shape the national narrative in their favor."
