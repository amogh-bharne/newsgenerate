Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday took a swipe at Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, questioning whether chanting “Jai Samvidhaan” (Long live Constitution) is allowed in Parliament, while alleging that those in power were not stopped from raising unparliamentary slogans. Her statement followed the swearing-in of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor from Thiruvananthapuram as a member of the 18th Lok Sabha. Tharoor took his oath in English while holding a copy of the Constitution and concluded with “Jai Hind, Jai Samvidhaan.” Opposition members echoed Tharoor’s chant of “Jai Samvidhaan,” prompting the Speaker to remind them that they were already taking their oaths on the Constitution. Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda from Haryana argued that the Speaker should not have objected. The Speaker retorted, “Don’t give advice on what to object to and what not to. Sit down.”

Reacting to this, Priyanka Gandhi posted on X, “Can't ‘Jai Samvidhaan’ be chanted in the Indian Parliament? Those in power were not stopped from raising unparliamentary and unconstitutional slogans in Parliament, but objections were raised when an opposition MP chanted ‘Jai Samvidhaan’. The anti-constitution sentiment that emerged during the elections has now taken a new form, seeking to weaken our Constitution. “The Constitution by which Parliament functions, the Constitution by which every member takes an oath, the Constitution by which every citizen gets the protection of life and livelihood—will this same Constitution now be opposed to suppress the voice of the opposition?” she questioned.

The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha began on Monday with the swearing-in of all newly elected Members of Parliament and will run until July 3. Following the two-day swearing-in ceremony, the election for the Lok Sabha Speaker was held on June 26.

Om Birla was elected as Speaker for second consecutive term. Opposition leaders made a strong point by repeatedly mentioning their increased strength in the House and exhorting the Speaker to be ‘neutral and impartial’.

Robert Vadra expresses happiness over Priyanka's decision and hints at his own entry into Parliament. The political discourse involves discussions on dynasty politics, family interests, and the prospect of a secular government. NEW DELHI: Taking a jibe at Congress's decision to field Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, BJP on Tuesday said the opposition party may now consider her husband Robert Vadra for the upcoming Palakkad assembly bypoll. In a post on X, BJP's Kerala unit chief K Surendran said, ""Rahul Gandhi claimed that Wayanad is his family. Now, he has decided the candidature of his own sister Priyanka Gandhi to the upcoming byelection in Wayanad.  Hope Rahul will field his brother-in-law Robert Vadra in the Palakkad byelection. Now, the people clearly understand Rahul's family sentiments. It's once again proven beyond doubt that Congress is a tool for the so-called Nehru-Gandhi family to serve their family's interest. Pathetic."" Vadra said he was happy that Priyanka was going to contest from Wayanad. Asked about him being in Parliament, Vadra said he could follow Priyanka at the right time. ""They're (BJP) worried, troubled. They're huddling together to understand what next to do. Priyanka will be raising issues. She gave the slogan - 'ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon'. She has been fighting for women for long. Voices of women will be raised. BJP should look at its history. They can't talk about parivarvaad. People don't want to hear them any more. We will fight them and ensure a secular govt,"" Vadra said. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said, ""It proves that Congress is not a party but a family company."" Meanwhile, in a post on X, former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar accused Congress of betraying the people of Wayanad and concealing its intentions. ""There is shamelessness and there is Congress type of shamelessness - imposing one member after another of their dynasty on voters of Wayanad, after shamelessly hiding the fact that Rahul was contesting from another constituency,"" he said.",,,"Debate in Parliament Over 'Jai Samvidhaan' Chant and Priyanka Gandhi's Criticism of Speaker's Conduct

","The recent session of the 18th Lok Sabha witnessed a contentious moment when Congress MP Shashi Tharoor concluded his oath with the chant ""Jai Samvidhaan"" (Long live the Constitution). This sparked a debate, as opposition members echoed the chant, prompting Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to remind them that their oaths were already being taken on the Constitution. Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, questioned whether this reaction from the Speaker was appropriate.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to social media to express her concerns, stating that while ruling party members have previously raised slogans in Parliament that could be considered unparliamentary, the opposition was being reprimanded for expressing their support for the Constitution. She argued that the very Constitution, which ensures the functioning of Parliament and the rights of its members and citizens, should not be used as a tool to suppress the voice of the opposition.

The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, which began with the swearing-in of newly elected MPs, will continue until July 3. The session has already seen the re-election of Om Birla as the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, marking his second consecutive term. Opposition leaders have emphasized the need for the Speaker to maintain neutrality and impartiality, especially in light of the increased strength of the opposition in the House.

Meanwhile, the political discourse outside Parliament also heated up with the BJP criticizing Congress for fielding Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, previously held by Rahul Gandhi. BJP leaders have suggested that Congress is continuing its tradition of dynasty politics by promoting members of the Gandhi family, including the possibility of Robert Vadra, Priyanka's husband, contesting in future elections.

Robert Vadra responded to these speculations, expressing his happiness over Priyanka's decision to contest from Wayanad and hinting at his own potential entry into Parliament. He criticized the BJP for what he described as their obsession with the Gandhi family, while Congress leaders defended their decision as a strategy to strengthen their presence in key constituencies.

The exchange of words between the two major political parties reflects the ongoing debate over dynasty politics and the role of family interests in Indian politics. As the Lok Sabha session continues, these discussions are likely to influence the tone and direction of parliamentary debates in the coming days.

The Emergency imposed in 1975 was the darkest chapter of a direct attack on the Constitution, President Droupadi Murmu said today in her address to a joint sitting of Parliament. This is her first address to Parliament after the general election elected a new Lok Sabha.
The Constitution, she said, has stood up to every challenge and every test in the past decades. ""Today is 27th June. The imposition of Emergency on 25th June, 1975, was the biggest and darkest chapter of direct attack on the Constitution. The entire country felt outraged.""

""But the country emerged victorious over such unconstitutional forces as the traditions of the republic lie at the core of India,"" she said, amid cheers from the treasury benches and protests by the Opposition. Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar echoed the President on the Emergency and said it had ""attacked the Constitution"". 

The President's remark comes against the backdrop of a heated exchange between the ruling BJP and the Opposition on Emergency. While central ministers, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have stressed on the horrors of the Emergency imposed by the Indira Gandhi government, the Congress and its allies have said an ""undeclared emergency"" is in the force over the past 10 years of Narendra Modi government.

The President's remarks also play out in the context of the Opposition's Constitution push. In demonstrations outside the House and proceedings inside it, Opposition MPs have been holding up copies of the Constitution and accusing the ruling party of undermining it.

""My Government also does not consider the Constitution of India as just a medium of governance; rather we are making efforts to ensure that our Constitution becomes a part of public consciousness,"" the President said in her address.

The President's address to Parliament is broadly a document that outlines the government's achievements and lays out is vision for the future. The address is essentially prepared by the government and is followed by a debate on the Motion of Thanks.

India, the President said, has become the fastest growing major economy in the world and has gone from the 11th spot in 2014 to the 5th in terms of the size of economy. She said the government is now focused on its goal of making India the third-largest economy. ""The government is giving equal priority to all three arms: manufacturing, services and agriculture. India is becoming Atmanirbhar in every field at a rapid pace.""

The President's address also touched upon the burning issue surrounding irregularities in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), an all-India exam for admission to medical courses.

The government, she said, is fully committed to investigating the recent incidents of paper leaks and ensure that the guilty are punished. As she made the remarks, cries of ""NEET"" were heard from the Opposition benches.

""Sanctity, transparency are a must in government recruitments and examinations. The government is committed to conduct fair investigation and ensure the most stringent punishment to those guilty in the recent incidents of paper leak,"" she said, adding that there is a need to rise above ""partisan politics"" and take strong steps on this issue.

Stressing on the need for the Parliament to run smoothly, she said opposition of policies and obstruction of parliamentary functioning are different.

""When Parliament conducts its business smoothly, when healthy deliberations take place here, when far-reaching decisions are taken, then the people repose confidence not only in the Government but also in the entire system. Therefore, I am confident that every moment of Parliament will be fully utilised and public interest will be given priority,"" she said.

According to a letter released by the Congress and sent by Venugopal to the Speaker, “Making of such a political reference from the Chair is unprecedented in the annals of history of Parliament.”

“I am writing this in the context of a very grave matter impacting upon the very credibility of the institution of Parliament. Yesterday, that is 26 June 2024, at the time of offering felicitations on your election as Speaker Lok Sabha, there was a general camaraderie in the House as such occasions generate,” he said in the letter.  “However, what followed thereafter, which is a reference from the Chair after your acceptance speech, in regard to the declaration of Emergency half a century ago, is deeply shocking. Making of such a political reference from the Chair is unprecedented in the annals of the history of Parliament. This coming from the Chair as one of the ‘first duties’ from a newly elected Speaker assumes even graver proportions,” he added.

“I, on behalf of the Indian National Congress, express our profound concern and anguish over this travesty of Parliamentary traditions,” he said.

On Wednesday (June 26th), Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla condemned the ‘dictatorial’ proclamation of Emergency that was announced by the previous Congress government led by then PM Indira Gandhi in 1975. He described it as the black chapter in India’s history. He also asked the House to observe 2 minutes of silence to mourn the ‘murder of democracy’, a day after the country entered the 50th year of Emergency that started in June 1975.  

Addressing the Lok Sabha, Om Birla said, “This house condemns the Emergency that was imposed in 1975 in the strongest terms. We also laud the determination of all those who staunchly opposed the Emergency, struggled, and performed the duty of safeguarding India’s democracy. 25th June 1975 will always be remembered as a black chapter in Indian history. On that day, then PM Indira Gandhi imposed an Emergency in the country and made a major blow to the constitution drafted by Dr BR Ambedkar.” The Lok Sabha speaker further slammed the erstwhile Congress-led government for imposing dictatorship on India. He also highlighted the excesses which were committed during the Emergency period.

Om Birla asserted, “Our young generation should know about the black phase of democracy. During the dark phase of the Emergency, scores of people lost their lives at the hands of Congress’ dictatorial government. We (the house) will observe 2 minutes of silence in their honor.”  

Notably, the Lok Sabha speaker made these remarks after PM Modi introduced ministers to the LS. 

",,,"President and Lok Sabha Speaker Reflect on Emergency, NEET Issues, and the State of Indian Democracy","In her address to a joint session of Parliament, President Droupadi Murmu emphasized the government’s commitment to upholding the Constitution and addressing recent issues such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) paper leaks. Her speech touched on various aspects of governance, including the significance of the Constitution, economic progress, and the need for transparency in government examinations.

On June 27, President Murmu highlighted the Emergency imposed in 1975 as a “dark chapter” in India’s history, describing it as a direct attack on the Constitution. She lauded the resilience of the Indian people and the Constitution in overcoming such challenges. The President’s remarks were met with approval from the ruling party and protests from the opposition, who have accused the current government of undermining democratic principles.

The President also addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding irregularities in the NEET examination. She assured the Parliament that the government is committed to investigating the recent incidents of paper leaks and ensuring that those responsible are held accountable. Opposition members, who have been vocal about the issue, expressed their concerns during the session, leading to a tense exchange.

The Lok Sabha session has also been marked by discussions on the role of the Emergency in Indian history. Speaker Om Birla, in his acceptance speech, condemned the Emergency as a ""black chapter"" and called for a two-minute silence to honor those who suffered during that period. His remarks have sparked criticism from the Congress party, with MP KC Venugopal expressing concern over the Speaker’s political commentary. Venugopal argued that such statements from the Chair are unprecedented and could undermine the credibility of the Parliament.

In her address, President Murmu also highlighted India’s economic achievements, noting that the country has become the fastest-growing major economy and is on track to become the third-largest economy in the world. She emphasized the government's focus on promoting growth across manufacturing, services, and agriculture, and the importance of making India self-reliant (Atmanirbhar).

The President concluded her speech by stressing the importance of smooth parliamentary functioning and constructive debates. She urged all members to prioritize public interest and work together to strengthen the democratic process. The session, which began with the swearing-in of newly elected MPs, will continue until July 3 and is expected to include further debates on key issues facing the nation.

New Delhi: The 'sengol' installed next to the Speaker's chair in Lok Sabha has emerged as the latest flashpoint this Parliament session after Opposition MPs questioned its relevance in a democracy and the BJP accused them of disrespecting Indian culture.
The ongoing debate over 'sengol', a handcrafted, gold-plated sceptre about 5-feet long, has been triggered by Samajwadi Party MP RK Chaudhary's letter to Speaker Om Birla. The MP from Mohanlalganj has said the 'sengol' must be replaced by a copy of the Constitution.

""The adoption of the Constitution marked the beginning of democracy in the country, and the Constitution is its symbol. The BJP government in its last term installed 'sengol' next to the Speaker's chair. Sengol is a Tamil word that means sceptre. Rajdand also means the king's stick. We have become independent after the age of kings. Now, every man and woman who is an eligible voter chooses the government to run this country. So will the country run by Constitution or by a king's stick?"" he told news agency ANI. The former Uttar Pradesh minister demanded that the 'sengol' be replaced by a copy of the Constitution to ""save democracy"".  The Samajwadi Party is the third-largest party in this Lok Sabha, after Akhilesh Yadav led it to a stellar show by winning 37 seats in Uttar Pradesh.

Asked about his party MP's remark, Mr Yadav said, ""When 'sengol' was installed, the Prime Minister had bowed to it. But he forgot to bow while taking oath this time. I think our MP wanted to remind the Prime Minister about it.""

Senior Congress leader and MP B Manickam Tagore echoed the Samajwadi Party MP on the 'sengol' row. ""We have been very clear that the 'sengol' symbolises kingship and the kingdom-era is over. We should celebrate the people's democracy and the Constitution,"" he told NDTV.

Mr Chaudhary's demand was also backed by RJD MP and Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Misa Bharti. ""Whosoever has demanded this, I welcome it,"" she said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the Samajwadi Party has no respect for Indian history or culture. ""The remarks of their top leaders on the Sengol are condemnable and indicate their ignorance. It also shows INDIA bloc's hatred to Tamil culture in particular,"" Yogi Adityanath said. The Opposition's 'sengol' offensive also plays out against the backdrop of the INDIA bloc's Constitution push to take on the third Narendra Modi government. From the beginning of this session, the Constitution has been a common sight in the Opposition's gatherings. On the first day of the session, top INDIA leaders Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, among others, staged a demonstration on Parliament premises holding copies of the Constitution. The INDIA MPs, including Mr Gandhi and Mr Yadav, also held copies of the Constitution while taking the oath.

The BJP, meanwhile, has hit back at the Opposition over its 'sengol' offensive. ""The Samajwadi Party earlier attacked and abused Ramcharitmanas and now Sengol, which is part of Indian culture and particularly Tamil culture. The DMK must clarify if they support this insult of 'sengol',"" he said.


During the 'sengol's installation in Lok Sabha last year, Home Minister Amit Shah had said it was an attempt to link our cultural traditions with our modernity. ""We want the administration to run by the rule of law, and this will always remind us of that,"" he said.





",https://www.opindia.com/2024/06/parliament-building-sengol-how-opposition-politicians-have-been-focusing-on-needless-controversies/,"New Parliament building, now Sengol: How Opposition politicians have been focusing on needless controversies instead of doing their jobs","The I.N.D.I. Alliance following ten years in opposition and three unsuccessful efforts to oust Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has reverted to its old strategies of raising frivolous issues to criticize the recently elected administration, instead of making better use of their time. Now, they have picked ‘Sengol‘ which was installed next to the speaker’s chair in Lok Sabha as a symbol of India’s sovereignty to demonstrate their lack of genuine concerns and demanded its removal from the newly constructed Indian parliament.

Samajwadi Party MP RK Chaudhary wrote to pro-tem speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab on 25th June and questioned its presence in the parliament. He stated, “Today, I took oath in this honourable chamber that ‘I will bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of India as by law established’ but I was shocked to see the ‘Sengol’ on the right side of the chair of the house. The constitution is a sacred document and the symbol of India’s democracy while ‘Sengol’ is a symbol of monarchy.”

Chaudhary added, “In its previous tenure, the BJP government under the leadership of PM Modi installed ‘Sengol’ in parliament. ‘Sengol’ means ‘Raj-Dand.’ It also means ‘Raja ka Danda.’ After ending the princely order, the country became independent. Will the country be run by ‘Raja ka Danda’ or the constitution? Our parliament is a temple of democracy, not a palace of some king or royal. I demand that ‘Sengol’ be removed from parliament and replaced by a large replica of the constitution.”  Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav supported his party leader and claimed, “When ‘Sengol’ was installed, the Prime Minister had bowed to it but he forgot to bow while taking oath this time. I think our MP wanted to remind him about it.” Senior Congress leader and MP B Manickam Tagore echoed the same sentiment and voiced, “We have been very clear that the ‘Sengol’ symbolises kingship and the kingdom-era is over. We should celebrate the people’s democracy and the constitution.” Rashtriya Janata Dal MP and Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter Misa Bharti also declared, “Whosoever has demanded this, I welcome it.”

RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha too joined the chorus and alleged, “We had protested and said that ‘Sengol’ is a symbol of the monarchy when it was being installed in the parliament. Our PM has the conduct of the kings.” He then brought up issues including jewellery, dresses, mangalsutra and mujra among others which were used by the prime minister to expose the opposition during his election campaign. The parliamentarian then added, “Now, only these topics will be discussed in the country. It is better to put a big replica of the constitution there which will run the nation.”  Notably, the Congress, its ideological sister parties and their ecosystem have historically found a profound delight in demeaning India’s cultural and historical symbols in the name of democracy, secularism, and the constitution and ‘Sengol’ was no exception. Interestingly, they never find any other religion or its symbol to be at odds with India’s democracy. 

How Congress reduced ‘Sengol’ to a mere walking stick
Lord Mountbatten asked Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, over the appropriate cultural symbol to signify the transfer of power when it was agreed that the British would cede control to the Indians and end their colonial rule. The latter took some time and spoke with C Rajagopalachari about the issue who informed Jawaharlal Nehru about the ‘Sengol’ after reading several books on history. The ‘Sengol’ was then sent to the first prime minister of India by the head of the Thiruvaduthurai Mutt Sri La Sri Ambalavana Desika Swamigal, who agreed to its use as a symbol of power.

The practice was evocative of the ancient customs of the Chola dynasty where it was customary for spiritual leaders known as Samayacharyas to oversee the crowning of kings and sanctify the transfer of power, a symbolic gesture of approval for the ruler. The sceptre received by Pandit Nehru was crafted from silver and plated with gold, on a special order from the Adheenam. This was handcrafted by jeweler Vummidi Bangaru Chetty in Madras and served as a replica of the original ‘Sengol’ however, it was highly revered as it symbolised the glorious tradition of the great Chola empire.

The sacred sceptre, shockingly, was soon forgotten and was housed as “Jawahar Lal Nehru’s golden walking stick” at a Prayagraj museum. The true origins and reasons for a significant artifact being displayed in a museum as a walking stick remained unknown, but it has now been rightfully recognized and honoured in the new Parliament under the Modi government. However, gauging from the actions of the Congress-led opposition in the present, it is evident how a momentous symbol was reduced to a mere footnote in the annals of history during their time as the only centre of authority in the nation.

Opposition and their persistent tendency to inflate non-issues
The opposition, in their eagerness to attack the Bharatiya Janata party-led National Democratic Alliance, has resorted to making absurd accusations instead of focusing on real problems and offering constructive criticism. The opposition even opposed PM Modi’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project which involved the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue, the area between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate. The most significant part of the project was the construction of a new parliament building. Rahul Gandhi in all his wisdom had even tweeted, “Central Vista-not essential. Central Government with a vision-essential.” Sitaram Yechury, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also denounced the administration, charging it with “circumventing” the shutdown.

Ironically, it was the vision of the Modi government which addressed the significant issue of the impending expansion of the parliament owing to the increased population which nearly quadrupled since independence. The Delhi High Court and Supreme Court also denied petitions against the project, further embarrassing the opposition. In another display of utter ignorance or perhaps goodwill for India’s British rulers, the opposition even slammed the government for renaming “Rajpath” which meant Kingsway to “Kartavya Path” which translates to the path of duty.

Opposition had issues with the lions in the national emblem installed over the new parliament building
The mockery of Indian voters who elected their representatives to address important matters reached new heights when opposition leaders suggested that the lions in the national emblem which was erected on top of the new parliament building were “fiercer and had sharper teeth” in comparison to the original statue in Sarnath. The politicians and their lackeys charged that the lions looked angry whereas they should be ‘peaceful’ and ‘calm’ and accused the Modi government of changing the national emblem.

",,,Debate Over 'Sengol' in Parliament Sparks Controversy Across Political Lines,"The installation of the 'sengol'—a 5-foot-long, gold-plated sceptre—next to the Speaker's chair in the Lok Sabha has become a focal point of debate in the ongoing Parliament session. The sceptre, which was introduced by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during its previous term, has drawn criticism from opposition parties, who question its relevance in a democratic institution and call for its replacement with a copy of the Constitution.

Samajwadi Party MP RK Chaudhary initiated the controversy by writing to Speaker Om Birla, arguing that the 'sengol' symbolizes monarchy, which contradicts the democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution. Chaudhary’s letter stated, ""The adoption of the Constitution marked the beginning of democracy in the country, and the Constitution is its symbol. We have become independent after the age of kings. So will the country run by the Constitution or by a king's stick?""

Akhilesh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party, supported Chaudhary's stance, noting that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi had bowed to the 'sengol' during its installation, he did not do so while taking the oath of office this time. Senior Congress leader B Manickam Tagore also voiced his opposition, stating that the 'sengol' represents an era of kingship that is incompatible with modern democratic values. These sentiments were echoed by other opposition leaders, including RJD MP Misa Bharti.

The BJP has responded strongly to the opposition’s criticism, accusing them of disrespecting Indian culture and heritage. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath condemned the remarks, suggesting that they reflect ignorance and a disregard for Tamil culture. He further accused the opposition, particularly the INDIA bloc, of harboring disdain for India’s cultural symbols.

The debate over the 'sengol' has unfolded against the backdrop of the INDIA bloc's broader campaign to emphasize the importance of the Constitution. During the first day of the Parliament session, leaders from various opposition parties, including Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, and Rahul Gandhi, held demonstrations holding copies of the Constitution. This symbolic gesture has been a consistent feature of their efforts to challenge the policies of the Modi government.

The BJP has countered the opposition's narrative by defending the inclusion of the 'sengol' as a symbol that links India's rich cultural heritage with its modern democratic ethos. During the installation of the sceptre last year, Home Minister Amit Shah emphasized that it serves as a reminder that the administration should be guided by the rule of law.

The historical significance of the 'sengol' dates back to India’s independence, when it was presented to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a symbol of the transfer of power from British colonial rule to India. The sceptre, originally crafted by jeweler Vummidi Bangaru Chetty, was intended to evoke the ancient traditions of the Chola dynasty, where such sceptres were used to symbolize the legitimacy of the ruler.

The opposition’s focus on the 'sengol' is the latest in a series of challenges to the Modi government’s policies and initiatives. Critics within the opposition have also raised concerns about other aspects of the Central Vista redevelopment project, which includes the construction of a new Parliament building. Despite these challenges, the government has maintained that these initiatives are essential for accommodating India’s growing population and modernizing its institutions.

As the debate continues, it highlights the broader ideological divide between the ruling party and the opposition over the role of cultural symbols in modern Indian democracy. While the BJP views the 'sengol' as a bridge between India’s past and present, the opposition sees it as a relic of a bygone era that should not overshadow the foundational principles of the Constitution.

Six people were arrested after the mob attack on Fareed (35) on Tuesday night in Mamu Bhanja locality, police said. Seven people, part of the mob, have been identified.

According to a complaint filed by the victim's family, Fareed was returning home from work when he was mobbed and thrashed by some residents on Tuesday night in the Mamu Bhanja locality over suspicion of theft, Superintendent of Police City M Shekhar Pathak said. By the time police reached the spot, Fareed was seriously injured and was rushed to the Malkhan Singh Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, the SP said.

As the news of the incident spread, many people gathered at the hospital and demanded the arrest of the accused, he said.

Pathak said the arrests have been made based on CCTV footage, and some other unidentified people have also been booked. Further investigation is underway.

SSP Sanjay Suman told the reporters that all precautionary measures have been enforced. Police and RAF (Rapid Action Force) have been deployed in sensitive localities including Subzi Mandi and Abdul Kareem Chowk.

These assertions were endorsed by elements like Mohammad Zubair as well. On the 18th of June 2024, a Muslim man called Mohammed Farid, who was also known as “Aurangzeb” was killed after being beaten up by Hindus in  Aligarh. According to the  Aligarh police, Aurangzeb had entered a Hindu house with the intention to steal. Thereafter, he was caught hold by the family and beaten up, leading to his death. 

The Aligarh police in their statement said that the Hindus and Muslims had both protested, however, contrary to some media reports there were no incidents of stone pelting reported from the area.

The incident occurred in the Mamu Bhanja locality around 10:15 PM on Tuesday and the deceased has been identified as Mohammed Farid alias Aurangzeb (35), a resident of the Ghas Ki Mandi locality.

The police arrested 6 Hindus after filing an FIR against 10 named accused and dozens of unidentified Hindus accused.

While the police said the situation was under control and there was no law and order issue in the locality, on Wednesday, Hindu and Muslim groups protested demanding justice.

The Hindu side demanded that those arrested should be released, while the Muslim side demanded justice for Aurangzeb, who had entered a Hindu house late at night.

Samajwadi Party (SP) leader came out in defense of Aurangzeb. “No one has the right to take the law in their hands. Even if there was suspicion of Aurangzeb being a thief, he should have been handed over to the police. None had any right to beat the man to death even if there was a suspicion,” local Samajwadi Party leader Ajju Ishaq, who led the protest against the incident, said. “The country will run by the Constitution and law of land and a man, even if suspect, cannot be lynched on religious identity.”

On the other hand, BJP leader Mukta Raja has said that those Hindu boys arrested are innocent and are being falsely framed. She said that Aurangzeb entered the Hindu house with 4-6 other Muslim men. When caught, the others fled and Aurangzeb fell down the stairs, being caught. She has demanded a thorough investigation into the videos that have surfaced and demanded that no innocent person be punished.

On social media, Islamists and the usual elements, who give unbridled covering fire to Islamists, have started giving the ‘Muslim victimhood’ spin to the incident.

Zeyad Masroor Khan, who is a journalist and has worked with Reuters, Vice, DH, and Brut India, claimed that Aurangzeb had ‘gone to meet a friend and entered a neighborhood home by mistake’. Meer Faisal, whose misinformation about Hindus was used by ISIS to call for the genocide of Hindus, said that the mob which lynched Aurangzeb was a “Hindutva mob”.  Alishan Jafri, another Islamist who calls himself a journalist termed the incident an “anti-Muslim attack”. The lies were actively peddled by Mohammad Zubair of AltNews as well. With this dangerous narrative being peddled by the usual suspects, furthering the eternal Muslim victimhood narrative, it becomes imperative to analyze the publicly available information about this case and how the Islamists are indulging in the usual chicanery to blame Hindus and paint the thief as an innocent Muslim man who was lynched for his religious identity.

The FIR in the case was based on the complaint filed by Aurangzeb’s brother. Mohammed Zaki alleged that Aurangzeb was returning home from work when he was mobbed and thrashed by some residents in the Mamu Bhanja locality around 10:15 PM. “They (accused) gathered with the intention of killing brother Aurangzeb. They had lathi, stick, hockey (stick) and iron rod in hand and attacked my brother after identifying him as a Muslim, they killed him,” the complainant has alleged in the FIR.

After the police confirmed that Aurangzeb had indeed entered the house of a Hindu on Tuesday night, elements like Zeyad Masroor Khan started claiming that he was returning home from a friend’s place and had entered a ‘neighborhood house by mistake’. These assertions were endorsed by elements like Mohammad Zubair as well.

This narrative, needless to say, makes very little sense. The brother of the accused has claimed that Aurangzeb was innocently returning home and on his way, he was “identified as a Muslim and lynched to death”. This assertion is debunked immediately after the police have confirmed that he indeed did enter a Hindu house with the intention to steal. The goalpost shift by OGWs claiming that he entered the Hindu house “by mistake” is outlandish, to say the least. They are essentially claiming that while walking on the road, a 35-year-old man, for no apparent reason, simply “by mistake” entered a random house that happened to be one of a Hindu. Nobody enters strange houses late at night, with no ‘intention’ and ‘by mistake’. This is a narrative being peddled simply to demonize Hindus and paint the thief as an innocent Muslim victimized for his religious identity.

Now that it has been established that Aurangzeb did enter a Hindu house late at night, it becomes important to analyze the claim that he was lynched owing to his Muslim identity.

If a strange man enters the house where a family is dwelling late at night, it is unthinkable that the family would first ask the intruder his religious identity before deciding to defend themselves. In a house with women and children, the first instinct, I daresay, would be to assume the worst and with force, if necessary, defend the life and honor of the family from the intruder. To assume that the family, whose house was broken into, would first ask the religious identity of the intruder and spare the perpetrator if he turned out to be a Hindu and defend themselves only if the perpetrator was a Muslim is a myopic narrative furthered only to paint Islamists as the eternal victims.

The narrative about Aurangzeb being beaten up for his Muslim identity is one being furthered by the SP leader Ajju Ishaq and the Islamists on social media, who pretend to be journalists and commentators.

Of course, ideally, nobody should take the law into their own hands and Aurangzeb should have been handed over to the police for further investigation and action. However, defending oneself and one’s family from intruders is human instinct, which in this case led to an illegal action, however, the reaction of the family and the locals would have been the same regardless of the religious identity of the perpetrator. Therefore, to brand this incident as an anti-Muslim attack by a “Hindutva mob” is nothing more than propaganda to target Hindus.







",,,"Man Lynched in Aligarh Over Theft Allegations: Communal Tensions Arise

","In Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, a 35-year-old man, identified as Mohammed Fareed, also known as Aurangzeb, was allegedly lynched by a mob on Tuesday night, sparking communal tensions in the area. The incident occurred in the Mamu Bhanja locality around 10:15 PM, where Fareed was accused of theft after reportedly entering a house in the neighborhood.

According to the police, Fareed was attacked by residents who suspected him of intending to steal. The situation escalated, leading to his severe beating. Despite the police's efforts to intervene, Fareed succumbed to his injuries at the Malkhan Singh Hospital.

In response to the incident, the police arrested six individuals and filed an FIR against 10 named and several unidentified persons. Superintendent of Police (City) M Shekhar Pathak confirmed that the arrests were based on CCTV footage and eyewitness accounts. He also assured the public that further investigations are ongoing.

The lynching has led to protests from both Hindu and Muslim communities in the area. Muslim groups, including leaders from the Samajwadi Party (SP), have condemned the attack, stating that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands, regardless of the circumstances. SP leader Ajju Ishaq emphasized that even if there were suspicions of theft, the proper course of action would have been to hand the suspect over to the police.

On the other side, some Hindu groups, led by local BJP leaders, have defended the actions of those involved, asserting that they were protecting their homes and that the accused are being falsely framed. BJP leader Mukta Raja has called for a thorough investigation into the incident, expressing concerns about the fairness of the arrests.

The incident has also ignited a debate on social media, with various narratives emerging. Some claim that Fareed was targeted due to his religious identity, while others argue that the situation was a result of a genuine fear of theft. The police have refuted claims of stone-pelting and other large-scale violence in the aftermath of the incident, stating that the situation remains under control.

To prevent further escalation, the police have intensified patrolling in sensitive areas and deployed additional forces, including the Rapid Action Force (RAF). The sector scheme has been enforced in all sensitive parts of the city to maintain peace.

As the investigation continues, the incident has highlighted the fragile communal situation in Aligarh, with both communities expressing concerns over justice and safety. The authorities are working to ensure that the law is upheld and that no further violence occurs.

This, despite total numbers of registered voters in the country going up by 7.2 crore in this period.  New Delhi: The total number of eligible voters in the country shot up from 89.6 crores in 2019 to 96.8 crores in 2024. But in the first five phases of polling, a dip of ~19.4 crore (19,37,72,469) votes was recorded in the ongoing 2024 Lok Sabha elections in comparison to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, data made available by the Election Commission of India reveals.

 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 426 seats polled in the first five phases while in the 2024 polls, voting was conducted for a total of 428 constituencies, that is two seats more than in 2019. 

In 2019, 70.1 crore (70,16,69,757) votes were recorded in the first five phases, while in 2024, a total 50.7 crore (50,78,97,288) votes were recorded.

 The comparison has been made possible after the Election Commission of India, facing unprecedented and sustained public pressure, released the absolute numbers of voters for the five phases that were completed on May 20 (Monday).  

Phase One

According to the data now made available by the Election Commission, in phase 1 of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 11,00,52,103 votes were recorded across 102 seats. In comparison, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 14,20,54,978 were recorded in the first phase in which polls were conducted to 91 seats. 3.2 crore votes less have been cast in 2024, in comparison with 2019, in the first phase.  Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 1: 3,20,02,875

 Phase Two

 In the second phase of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the dip has been bigger than the first phase, of 4.9 crores (4,94,18,900). This, when the number of seats that went to polls in 2024 in the second phase were more than in 2019.

 A total of 10,58,30,572 votes were recorded across 88 seats in the second phase in 2024 in comparison to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when a total of 15,52,49,472 votes were recorded after polling to 95 seats. 

Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 2: 4,94,18,900

 Phase Three

 In the third phase of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, there has been a dip of 7.5 crore (7,52,74,480) votes recorded in comparison to the previous election. A total of 18,85,09,156 votes were recorded after polling to 117 seats in the third phase of 2019 in comparison to a total of 11,32,34,676 votes recorded after polling to 93 seats in 2024’s third phase.

Of course, in the third phase, the number of seats in which voting took place, were significantly more in 2019, as compared to 2024. 

 Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 3: 7,52,74,480

Phase Four  

In the fourth phase, the difference between the two elections is 57.9 lakhs (57,98,110). This is despite the total number of seats that voted in this phase in 2024 being 24 more than in 2019, in the same phase. 

In 2019 a total of 12,82,67,429 votes were recorded across 72 seats and in 2024 a total of 96 seats recorded 12,24,69,319 votes.  Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 4: 57,98,110

Phase Five

In the fifth phase, the difference stands at 3.1 crores (3,18,78,104). In 2019 a total of 8,75,88,722 votes were recorded after polling to 51 seats in the fifth phase while in 2024 a total of 5,57,10,618 votes have been recorded in polling to 49 seats.

In the fifth phase of polling, in 2024, two less seats voted, in comparison with the fifth phase in 2019. Difference in absolute numbers in Phase 5: 3,18,78,104

According to a press release by the Election Commission of India in February, the total number of eligible voters in 2019 there were a total of 89.6 crore voters, which increased to 96.8 crores in 2024.

Data released after sustained pressure

 The data was released on Saturday, just two days after the Election Commission told the Supreme Court that there is no legal mandate for the commission to disclose voter turnout data based on Form 17C, or the record of votes polled in each polling station, and that such disclosure could be susceptible to misuse.    

The election-conducting body has filed the affidavit in response to an application filed by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Common Cause seeking immediate publication of voter turnout data in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.  

The Supreme Court on Friday, refused to direct the Election Commission to publish voter turnout data and said that a “hands-off” approach during the elections was required as it listed the matter to be heard after summer vacations. 

The Election Commission, while supplying the numbers, again said “Commission notes the pattern of false narratives and mischievous design to vitiate electoral process.” 

2019 Phases

As in 2024, in 2019 too polling was conducted over seven phases in 2019. 

The first vote was cast on April 11 and the last one on May 19. The results were declared on May 25. The phases were however spaced closer together with voting conducted on April 11, April 18, April 23, April 29, May 6, May 12 and May 19, 2019.

On Saturday, 25th May, leftist propaganda website ‘The Wire’ published a report with dubious voter turnout data for 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In the report, they are claiming that 19.4 crore fewer voters cast their votes in the first five phases of Lok Sabha Elections 2024 compared to the 2019 General Elections. According to The Wire, 70.1 crore votes were polled in 2019 across 426 seats, while in 2024 only 50.7 crore votes were polled.

Interestingly, just over 61 crore votes were polled in total in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but leftist propaganda website ‘The Wire’ concluded that over 70 crore votes were polled in the seats that went for elections in first 5 phases in 2024, implying there was negative turnout in remaining seats. How negative turnout is possible, only the great scientists at ‘The Wire’ can explain to us..

To support their claim, The Wire used five press releases by the Election Commission of India from 2019 and the latest absolute number of data released by the agency. However, they made a big blunder in calculating the numbers as they used total electorate of 2019 and not total votes. Archived links of The Wire’s report can be seen here and here. The Press Releases linked by The Wire for phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5 can be accessed here. The latest data released by EC can be checked here. The press release of the first phase used by The Wire is from 10th April while Polling date was 11th April. Similarly, phase 2 press release was from 16th April and the polling date was 18th April. The press release for phase 3 was from 22nd April and the polling date was 23rd April. Press release for phase 4 was from 26th April and the polling date was 29th April. The press release for the fifth phase was from 3rd May and the polling date was 6th May. Polling schedule for 2019 Elections can be seen here. Notably, in the header of all five press releases, the date of press release and date of polling were clearly mentioned.Now if we check the press releases from 2019, they were released before the polling dates, and not after. These press releases only had the number of total electorates from the said constituencies and not the votes polled in those phases.

OpIndia analysed all 427 constituencies and compared the data from the actual Election Commission data that can be checked here.

As per the data, there were 71,14,40,983 total voters in 2019 in the constituencies that went to poll in the first five phases of 2024, out of which 48,47,07,015 exercised their right to vote. That means 68.13% voting. In 2024, there were 76,40,80,337 registered voters out of which 50,72,97,288 voters exercised their right to vote. That makes 66.39% voting. It is evident that though the voting percentage reduced by 1.74%, the total number of voters who cast votes increased by 2,25,90,273 (2 crore, 25 lakh, 90 thousand and 273). Please note that we compared the voter turnout data of constituencies where the polling has been done and not the constituencies that were in the first five phases of 2019. Furthermore, the names of constituencies of Assam are different from 2019 due to delimitation exercise that took place in 2023. OpIndia’s data analysis of that can be checked here.










",,,Voter Turnout Analysis in 2024 Lok Sabha Elections: A Comprehensive Overview,"In the ongoing 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a significant decrease in voter turnout has been observed compared to the 2019 elections, raising concerns and discussions across the political spectrum. According to data released by the Election Commission of India (ECI), the total number of eligible voters increased from 89.6 crores in 2019 to 96.8 crores in 2024. However, the number of votes cast in the first five phases of the 2024 elections saw a decrease of approximately 19.4 crores compared to the same phases in 2019.

Phase-by-Phase Comparison

In the first phase of 2024, a total of 11 crore votes were recorded across 102 seats, whereas in 2019, 14.2 crore votes were cast across 91 seats, marking a decline of 3.2 crores. Similarly, in the second phase, the number of votes dropped by 4.9 crores, with 10.58 crore votes cast in 2024 compared to 15.52 crore votes in 2019, despite the fact that more seats were contested in 2024.

The third phase of voting also showed a significant decline, with 7.52 crore fewer votes recorded in 2024 compared to 2019. While 18.85 crore votes were cast in 2019 across 117 seats, only 11.32 crore votes were recorded across 93 seats in 2024.

In the fourth phase, although the number of seats increased from 72 in 2019 to 96 in 2024, the total number of votes cast decreased by 57.9 lakhs. The fifth phase similarly saw a reduction of 3.18 crore votes, with 5.57 crore votes cast in 2024 compared to 8.75 crore in 2019, across slightly fewer seats.

Political Reactions and Data Accuracy

The voter turnout data has sparked debates, with different political narratives emerging. Some outlets highlighted the decrease in voter turnout, raising concerns about possible voter apathy or disenfranchisement. Others scrutinized the accuracy of the data, with claims of discrepancies in the numbers and allegations of misreporting by certain media outlets.

For instance, a report from The Wire emphasized the 19.4 crore drop in voter turnout in the first five phases, using data from the ECI's press releases. However, this report was met with criticism from some quarters, particularly for allegedly misinterpreting the data by conflating total electorate numbers with actual votes cast.

In contrast, another analysis by OpIndia suggested that while the percentage of voter turnout slightly decreased from 68.13% in 2019 to 66.39% in 2024, the absolute number of voters who cast their votes actually increased by over 2.25 crores. This analysis highlighted the complexities of comparing voter turnout across different election cycles, especially considering changes in constituency boundaries and other electoral factors.

Conclusion

As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections progress, the observed dip in voter turnout remains a point of concern and discussion. The contrasting interpretations of voter data underscore the challenges in analyzing and presenting electoral information accurately. As the election process continues, these discussions are likely to evolve, with further data and analysis shaping the public and political discourse",,,
https://thewire.in/agriculture/india-contract-farming-ordinance-corporate-lifeline,Will India's Contract Farming Ordinance Be a Corporate Lifeline for Agriculture?,"Even though India has had a few relatively successful models, contract farming has failed to take off in a meaningful manner. Of the three agriculture-related ordinances promulgated on June 5, 2020, the most predictable was ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’.

Put simply, it provides a legal basis to the existing practice of contract farming in India’s agriculture and allied sectors.
In 2018, the Union Ministry of Agriculture circulated a model law on contract farming. It was called ‘The State /UT Agricultural Produce Contract Farming (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018’. The Ordinance draws from this model Act.

It is not that contract farming is new to India or it did not have any legal backing. Under the Model APMC Act, 2003 also, contract farming was permitted and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) were given the responsibility to record the contracts. They were also mandated to resolve the disputes in such contracts. However, market fee and other levies/charges were payable to APMCs.

Currently, contract farming requires registration with the APMC in a few states. This means that contractual agreements are recorded with the APMCs, which can also resolve disputes arising out of these contracts. Furthermore, market fees and levies are paid to the APMC to undertake contract farming.

According to Volume IV of the Dalwai Committee report, only 14 states have issued rules to govern contract farming. Despite this, it hasn’t taken off properly and only 15 companies have entered into contract farming for crops in Punjab, Haryana, MP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Most of these contracts are for cotton and barley. It is clear that contract farming is not yet mainstream.

In April 2013, the Akali government in Punjab passed the Punjab Contract Farming Act to provide a legal framework to contract farming. There were several protections in the Act to protect the interest of farmers – e.g. no recovery could be made from farmers by sale or mortgage of his land under contract. The Punjab Act did not have a provision mandating that sale cannot be below the MSP.

Due to opposition from various quarters, Punjab never notified the rules under the Act.

The Centre’s ordinance of June 5, 2020 attempts to provide a national framework for contract farming by bringing uniformity in provisions of contract farming under state regulation enacted under APMC Acts and the laws passed by some states on the lines of model Act circulated in 2018.

Basically, the Ordinance has three main features:

A farmers may enter into a written agreement which can specify terms and conditions of quality, grade, time of supply price and the extension services etc.
The agreement could be for a period of 1 to 5 years.
The price or any variation of the same has to be part of the agreement. For any additional amount over the agreed price, the prevailing price in APMC/electronic portal etc. will be the benchmark.
All contracts are to be registered with a state level authority to be set up by state governments. In addition, there are several other safeguards for farmers.

Many observers have been studying the reasons for the failure of contract farming to take off on a large scale, even though there are several examples of successful models evolving over the years. For example, seed production is mainly through contract farming between seed companies and producer farmers. The seed companies provide foundation seeds to farmers who, in turn, deliver certified seed to companies. The National Seed Corporation has a well-defined protocol for contract farming for seed production. Mostly, the farmers receive a price higher than the MSP and even the prevailing APMC prices. Generally, the farmers do not default on the delivery of seeds.

Generally the corporates, both processors and modern retailers, are reluctant to enter into formal contracts with hundreds of farmers and they use a middle man, called organiser. They fear that in case of any default by farmers, the political system will not support them irrespective of merit of the case.

For most hybrid seed production, the seed companies pay about 25% of agreed price to contract farmers on delivery of seed. Balance 75% amount is paid after conducting a genetic purity test, which is required for labelling of seed packets. This test can take about 70-80 days and farmers are paid the balance 75% of price only after this test confirms the purity of seed. The Ordinance provides for payment of 66% of seed price to farmers on delivery and 34% on certification. But the entire price has to be paid within 30 days. It has to be seen how the seed industry will adapt to this change of payment terms.

At present, informal contracts between industry and farmers are also quite common. In West Bengal, many small and marginal farmers grow chip grade potatoes under contractual arrangements, mostly without written contracts. Under this system, the company inspects the farms on a periodic basis and provides extension services.

There are apprehensions on the part of farmers to enter into contracts as they are not organised and are ill equipped for any legal battle with corporates. Only last year, a few Gujarat farmers were sued for more than Rs 1 crore for illegally growing and selling a potato variety registered by PepsiCo. On the intervention of the state government, PepsiCo withdrew the cases but the incidence left a question mark over the future of contract farming in which resource-poor farmers were pitted against a powerful multinational.

Other sectors provide a better example of what the future should look like. The most successful example of contract farming in India comes from the sugarcane and poultry sectors. An evaluation of contract farming of broilers by P.V.K. Sasidhar and Murari Suvedi found that contract farming had low marketing risk and that the farmers were promptly paid. The working capital requirement of farmers was also low and extension services were provided by the aggregator. However, the average net return per bird was Rs 11.06 for contract farmers while it was Rs 17.05 per bird for those farmers who did not participate in contract farming. So, the poultry producers under contract farming were losing Rs 5.99 per bird. This is the cost for avoiding the risk of disease, fluctuation of market prices and expert guidance from veterinarians.

On the whole, poultry farming is a successful example of small farmers benefiting from aggregators providing extension services, including feed and medicines and taking marketing risk. About 66% of poultry production is under contract farming. Poultry sector is uniquely placed as the prices of eggs are decided by the National Egg Coordination Committee, which takes demand and supply into account. So, unlike the farmers of most crops who face enormous fluctuation in prices, the poultry farmers are shielded from the same.

However, even in the US, contract farming of poultry has benefited producers more than the poultry farmers.

The top most concern of organised players wishing to enter contract farming is the place of minimum support price in their agreements. They are generally reluctant to sign agreements as they are not sure if the states will hold them accountable if the agreed price is below MSP.

A lot more clarity is required in government policy on this account.

The Ordinance provides for setting up of a registration authority in every state to electronically register the contracts. The states will do well to quickly notify the regulations governing the registration of contracts.

So far, modern retail has been largely purchasing perishable produce from mandis. Since the volumes of fresh produce are still low for modern retail and it has to compete with roadside vendors, it has been reluctant to invest in backend infrastructure.

Also read: What Will the End of the Road for APMCs Look Like?
This ordinance has the potential to change the contours of modern retail as it can expand its reach to better off consumers, willing to pay higher prices for fresh produce of higher grade which meets the standards of pesticide residue and food safety.

It is a good decision to exempt the produce under contract farming from stock limits under Essential Commodities Act. However, the Ordinance does not cover contract farming of sugarcane which will continue to be governed by Sugarcane (Control) Order 1966. It means that despite the purported concerns of Nitin Gadkari about high MSPs of several crops, as compared to global prices, the sugar mills will still have to pay fair and remunerative prices or the state advised prices. Indian sugar prices will therefore continue to be higher than global prices. MSP reforms can probably start from here.

The Ordinance says that the government will issue guidelines as well as model agreements. It means that this Ordinance is still work in progress.








",https://www.opindia.com/2021/03/gujarat-farmers-contract-farming-potatoes-benefit/,How farmers in Gujarat have benefitted with entry of private players and contract farming,"It appears that the opposition parties are opposing the new laws only because Modi government brought them in. The same old rhetoric of ‘farms will be sold to 4-5 big conglomerates’, ‘farmers will be rendered landless and exploited at the hands of few private players’ is being pushed forward by the kisan andolan leaders. The farmers agitating and holding Punjab and parts of Haryana and UP to ransom seem to be upset with farmers income doubling through open market and formalized contractual farming.

The fear mongering has made the farmers to believe that the private companies will take over their land. So let’s understand which section of the Farm Laws allows a company to buy a farmers land. Well the answer is none. There is no such provision in the Laws which enables a company to own farmers land or produce. However, this narrative is being played to mislead the farmers.


It is interesting to know that around 15 states in India have been practicing contractual farming in some way or the other.

What is contractual farming?
As explained in Krishi Jagran, contract farming is a method of agri-production where a purchaser approaches a farmer with specific requirements of production and marketing of a or multiple farm products. The farmer then offers to supply agreed-upon amounts of a given agricultural commodity as per the requirement stated in the contract. The farmer must ensure that the produce is as per purchaser’s quality requirements. In certain situations, the purchaser agrees to assist the farmer by providing necessary agricultural inputs, land planning, and technical guidance, among other things. 

Contractual farming in Indian states
Multiple states have loosely drafted bills in place for contractual farming which refrains a farmer from getting into such contracts. As mentioned by Tushar G in a Swarajya report, Punjab for example, introduced contract farming in the year 2002 under Captain Amarinder Singh’s government to decrease the share of cropped area under wheat and paddy and encourage diversification.

However, after the state government changed in 2007, stopped the financial help from UPA-led central government. This, coupled with lack of supply of good seeds, motivation to farmers and market support needed from state as well as central government were more or less absent. In 2013, the government made another attempt to pass Punjab Contract Farming Act which resembled the Farm laws but was met with strong opposition from the middlemen lobby.


In another report by the Indian Express, Maharashtra government had incorporated contract farming in its Agriculture Produce Marketing (Development and Facilitation) Act of 1964 in the year 2006. Just like the Centre’s Farm laws, Maharashtra had allowed farmers to enter into contracts with buyers to sell their produce at predetermined prices but the potential has remained untapped as retail chains have been reluctant to enter in contracts that last for a long period of time.

Role of Farm laws
What Centre has done with Farm laws is essentially weave the vaguely drafted state regulations in a watertight Act to ensure formalisation and protection of farmers and purchaser across the country promoting ‘one nation, one market’. Ensuring uniformity, the new laws have specific provisions to safeguard the interests of farmers. The Centre has repeatedly made it clear that contract farming is an option and not compulsion, selling outside of mandi is an option and not compulsion and no APMC will be shut.

Here is a brief round-up on what the new farm laws do: The land of farmers will remain with them
No buyer who gets into the contractual farming with farmers will be able to build permanent structures on the farm land.
The new farm laws say that there will be no action for recovery of dues against the farmers’ land.
Further, farmers get the choice and freedom to sell their produce to whoever they wish to. The Gujarat Model
No land has been sold to purchaser in India’s 30 years of contractual farming says a December 2020 report of online web portal DeshGujarat. In fact, the risk for farmers has gone substantially down after they got engaged into contract farming.

A moneycontrol report states that Jignesh Patel, a resident of Aravalli, Gujarat clocks Rs 25 crore annually, all thanks to contract farming. Patel’s family, who have been into potato farming for the past 26 years, began growing the LR potatoes (a special variety of potatoes) after pilot cultivation. They now produce produce 20,000 metric tonnes on an average and sell them to leading potato chips manufacturers such as Balaji and ITC.


In another report, an ITC official revealed that potato farmers in Gujarat earn as high as Rs 5 lakh per hectare. Sachid Madan, Chief Executive, fresh fruits and vegetables and frozen business, ITC said, “farmers make two times more income from growing potatoes for processing units,”. ITC is the maker of the popular potato snack brand, Bingo.

Adding to the success stories, ‘Tuber Foods Private Limited’ of Ahmedabad is all set to buy 400 tons of golden sweet potatoes at 25% higher rate than the market price from Maharajganj Vantangiya’s FPO ‘Maharajganj Vegetable Producing Company’. Specifying the deal, Ram Gulab, the director of Maharajganj Vegetable Producing Company said that the contract is for selling the produce and not the land and that contractual farming has come as a blessing for small farmers like them.


Banas Dairy, which is one of the 18 cooperative unions under the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), is setting up a Rs 100-crore (USD 13.5 million) potato processing unit in North Gujarat to take on popular and established brands like McCain Foods India Pvt Ltd and Hyfun Foods in India. The unit will have an annual capacity to process 50,000 metric tonnes of potatoes for production of French fries, a popular snack and 12 other potato products for both domestic and international markets in the South-East Asia. The company is currently procuring 7,000 metric tonne of potatoes from approximately 500 farmers in North Gujarat.

Private players working with farmers
Companies like BigBasket, Reliance Retail, Amazon, ITV, PepsiCo have been working closely with farmers to procure desired products directly, increasing farmers income by around 20%. PepsiCo still undertakes some amount of contract farming in Punjab. Punjab farmers, who had wholeheartedly embraced the reforms few years back, are not up in arms against the very same reforms at central level. It appears that the opposition parties are opposing the new laws only because Modi government brought them in.





",,,"Contract Farming in India: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Path Forward

","Contract farming, a system where agricultural production is carried out based on an agreement between a buyer and farmers, has been a subject of debate in India. The recent introduction of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, has brought this issue into sharper focus. This ordinance, part of a broader set of farm laws, aims to formalize and expand contract farming across the country, offering a legal framework that many believe is necessary for the agricultural sector's growth.

Historical Context and Existing Framework
Contract farming is not a new concept in India. Various states have experimented with it to varying degrees of success. For instance, under the Model APMC Act of 2003, contract farming was permitted, with Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) responsible for recording contracts and resolving disputes. Despite this, the practice remained limited, with only 14 states issuing rules to govern contract farming, according to the Dalwai Committee report.

In Punjab, the Punjab Contract Farming Act of 2013 was introduced to provide a legal framework for contract farming, including protections for farmers, such as prohibiting land recovery for unpaid dues. However, the Act was never fully implemented due to opposition from various groups, leaving the potential of contract farming largely untapped.

The 2020 Ordinance: A National Framework
The 2020 ordinance seeks to establish a national framework for contract farming, aiming to unify the various state regulations under a single, coherent law. Key features include allowing farmers to enter written agreements specifying terms such as quality, grade, time of supply, and price. These agreements can span 1 to 5 years, and the ordinance mandates that any price variation must be clearly outlined, with the prevailing price in APMCs or electronic portals serving as benchmarks.

The ordinance also provides for the registration of all contracts with a state-level authority, adding a layer of oversight. Additionally, it includes safeguards for farmers, such as prohibiting the seizure of land for unpaid dues and requiring the entire payment to be made within 30 days, with an interim payment of 66% upon delivery of the produce.

Opportunities and Success Stories
There have been several success stories in India that highlight the potential benefits of contract farming. In Gujarat, for example, farmers have successfully engaged in contract farming with companies like ITC, earning significantly higher incomes by growing specialized crops like potatoes for processing into snack foods. Similarly, the poultry sector in India has seen widespread adoption of contract farming, with around 66% of production occurring under such arrangements. Farmers benefit from reduced marketing risks, timely payments, and access to extension services, although they may earn slightly less per unit than those not under contract.

Challenges and Concerns
Despite these successes, contract farming has not become mainstream in India, and there are significant challenges to its widespread adoption. One of the main concerns is the reluctance of both farmers and corporate entities to enter into formal contracts. Farmers, particularly smallholders, fear that they may be at a disadvantage in disputes with powerful corporations. This fear was exemplified by a 2019 case where PepsiCo sued several farmers in Gujarat for unauthorized cultivation of a proprietary potato variety, though the case was eventually dropped.

Corporates, on the other hand, are hesitant to enter into contracts due to concerns about potential defaults by farmers and the possibility of political or legal backlash. Additionally, the role of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in contract farming agreements remains unclear, further complicating negotiations.

Looking Forward
The 2020 ordinance represents a significant step towards formalizing contract farming in India, offering a more structured and legally protected environment for both farmers and buyers. However, for this potential to be realized, several issues need to be addressed. Clearer guidelines on the role of MSPs in contracts, greater education and support for farmers, and swift notification of state regulations governing contract registration are all necessary.

Furthermore, building trust between farmers and corporates is crucial. The success of contract farming in sectors like poultry and in states like Gujarat shows that with the right support and safeguards, contract farming can offer substantial benefits to India's agricultural sector.

The future of contract farming in India depends on the effective implementation of these new laws and the willingness of all stakeholders to engage constructively. If successful, contract farming could play a key role in modernizing Indian agriculture, increasing farmer incomes, and ensuring food security in the country.

https://thewire.in/law/hemant-soren-jharkhand-high-court,No Reason to Believe Hemant Soren Guilty of Money Laundering Offence': Jharkhand HC Gives Bail,"The HC, examining the case records and chargesheet filed by the ED, held that 'none of the registers/revenue records bare imprint of the direct involvement of the petitioner (Soren) in the acquisition and possession of the said land.' New Delhi: The Jharkhand high court on June 28 granted bail to Hemant Soren, the state’s former chief minister who had to step down before he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on January 31.

Soren has been in the Ranchi Jail since. He walked out of the jail on Friday. After his release, Soren said, “I was kept behind bars for 5 months…We are seeing how the judicial process is taking years not just days or months…Today, it is a message for the whole country that how a conspiracy was hatched against us…The fight we started and the resolutions we made, we will work to fulfil them.” Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay gave the bail order after hearing the matter for over a month.

The ED’s case is that Soren, the head of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha which is part of the opposition INDIA alliance, misused his official position and illegally acquired 8.86 acres land in Ranchi which the agency has termed as “proceeds of crime”.

Rejecting this argument of the ED, the HC has held that “there is reason to believe that the petitioner is not guilty of the offence as alleged.”

Jharkhand HC, while granting bail to Soren, also dismissed the case of the ED stating that “overall conspectus of the case based on broad probabilities does not specifically or indirectly assign the petitioner (Soren) to be involved in the acquisition and possession as well as concealment of 8.86 acres of land at Shanti Nagar, Baragain, Ranchi connected to the proceeds of crime”.

The HC, examining the case records and also the chargesheet filed by the agency, also held that “none of the registers/revenue records bare imprint of the direct involvement of the petitioner (Soren) in the acquisition and possession of the said land.” Jharkhand HC has directed Soren to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount each.

With Election Commission planning to schedule Jharkhand assembly elections in October this year along with Maharashtra and Haryana, this development is a shot in the arm for JMM and also the united opposition, INDIA.

Along with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Soren’s arrest – just before the 2024 Lok Sabha election – is highlighted as one of the ways in which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was keen to suppress political opposition. The ED, a central agency, is under the direct control of the BJP-led union government.

Many had pointed out that while the judiciary granted Kejriwal interim bail so he could campaign during the long elections, Soren’s case had not been dealt with with the same ideas.

On May 10, when the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail, it disposed of Soren’s plea challenging his arrest by the ED as “infructuous” because by then the high court had delivered an unfavourable bail judgment – only after the apex court issued notice on the former chief minister’s petition on April 29.

On February 2, just after Soren’s arrest, Champai Soren, one of the most prominent figures in the movement for the creation of the separate state of Jharkhand, took oath as CM. Soren’s wife Kalpana, along with Champai, campaigned widely for the party in the polls.

Among the tribal population of Jharkhand, The Wire‘s ground reports revealed, Soren’s arrest led to significant anti-BJP sentiments.

Hemant Soren, the former chief minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha stalwart was granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court on 28th June. Soren was arrested by the ED in January this year in connection with a money laundering case involving a land scam.

According to his attorney, Arunabh Chowdhury, the court found him not guilty of the offence. He stated, “Bail has been granted to Soren. The court has held that prima facie he is not guilty of the offence and there is no likelihood of the petitioner committing an offence when on bail.” On 13th June, the high court reserved its decision regarding his bail petition.

SV Raju, the agency’s lawyer, contended that he would do a similar crime if he was allowed bail. The 48-year-old was eventually arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on 31st January in connection with its investigation into the money-laundering case after a protracted hide-and-seek scenario. The probe was related to an illegal possession of 8.36 acres of land. The inquiry focuses on large sums of money obtained through the falsification of official records, involving “fake sellers” and buyers who used forged or counterfeit paperwork to purchase enormous tracts of land worth crores.

The Jharkhand Police filed several First Information Reports (FIRs) in land “scam” cases against various individuals, including state government officials, which led to the money laundering inquiry. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party loyalist and state transport minister Champai Soren was named as his successor after his resignation. He reporetdly tried to dodge the inteorrgataion and even skipped nine Enforcement Directorate summons. Hemant Soren who is the executive president of the party is currently lodged in the Birsa Munda jail in Ranchi.

Notably, the Jharkhand Police had also issued to the ED officials after Soren had filed a case against the agency under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.  Soren had alleged that the ED’s searches at his residences were aimed at tarnishing his image and harassing him for being a tribal. But the Jharkhand High Court ordered no coercive action against ED officials after the agency filed a petition challenging Soren’s FIR.

The ED had claimed to have recovered Rs 36 lakh in cash and documents related to the investigation, alleging that Soren had acquired 8.5 acres of land through fraudulent means. The investigation revealed that a syndicate, including Revenue Sub-Inspector Bhanu Pratap Prasad, was involved in corrupt property acquisitions.

Soren’s petition to attend the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly’s budget session was dismissed by the High Court on February 29. He had resigned as Chief Minister following his arrest in the money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.",,,"Hemant Soren Granted Bail by Jharkhand High Court in Land Scam Case

","On June 28, the Jharkhand High Court granted bail to Hemant Soren, the former Chief Minister of Jharkhand, in a high-profile case involving allegations of money laundering related to a land scam. Soren, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on January 31, had been in custody for nearly five months prior to his release.

The case against Soren revolves around the alleged illegal acquisition of 8.86 acres of land in Ranchi, which the ED has described as ""proceeds of crime."" The agency accused Soren of misusing his official position to acquire the land through fraudulent means, involving the manipulation of official records and the use of ""fake sellers"" and counterfeit documents. The charges against Soren were part of a broader investigation into land scams in Jharkhand, which had led to multiple First Information Reports (FIRs) against various individuals, including state government officials.

In its ruling, the Jharkhand High Court examined the case records and the chargesheet filed by the ED. Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay, who presided over the bail hearing, noted that the evidence presented by the ED did not directly implicate Soren in the acquisition and possession of the disputed land. The court found that ""none of the registers/revenue records bare imprint of the direct involvement of the petitioner (Soren) in the acquisition and possession of the said land."" Consequently, the court concluded that there was ""reason to believe that the petitioner is not guilty of the offence as alleged.""

Soren's attorney, Arunabh Chowdhury, emphasized that the court's decision effectively exonerated Soren, stating, ""The court has held that prima facie he is not guilty of the offence and there is no likelihood of the petitioner committing an offence when on bail."" The court ordered Soren's release on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the same amount.

The ED, represented by its lawyer SV Raju, had argued against granting bail, expressing concerns that Soren might commit a similar offence if released. However, the court dismissed these concerns, noting the lack of direct evidence linking Soren to the alleged crime.

Soren's arrest and subsequent legal battles have been closely watched, particularly in the context of the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections, which are expected to be held later this year. His release on bail is likely to have significant political implications, especially for the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the party he leads, and the broader opposition alliance known as INDIA.

In the months leading up to his arrest, Soren had been a prominent figure in the state's political landscape. Following his arrest, Champai Soren, a senior leader of the JMM and a key figure in the movement for Jharkhand's statehood, was appointed as the new Chief Minister. Champai Soren, along with Soren's wife Kalpana, has been actively campaigning for the party in anticipation of the upcoming elections.

Soren's arrest also sparked considerable debate and controversy, particularly among Jharkhand's tribal population, where he enjoys significant support. Many in the state viewed his arrest as part of a broader effort by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to suppress political opposition. The ED, a central agency, has been accused of targeting opposition leaders under the BJP-led central government.

In addition to the criminal charges, Soren had also filed a case against the ED under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, alleging that the agency's actions were aimed at tarnishing his image and harassing him for being a tribal leader. The Jharkhand High Court, however, ordered no coercive action against the ED officials involved in the investigation.

As Soren prepares to return to the political arena, his release on bail marks a significant development in Jharkhand's ongoing political drama. The case continues to draw attention, and its outcome could have far-reaching implications for both Soren's political career and the state's upcoming elections.

Delhi Rains: One Dead, Several Injured as Roof Collapses at Airport Terminal 1

New Delhi: A roof at Terminal-1D of the Indira Gandhi International Airport collapsed early on Friday morning, killing at least one person – a taxi driver – and injuring several others. Check-in counters at the airport were closed because of safety concerns. There were massive traffic jams around the airport area, and all departing flights until 1 pm have been cancelled.

A roof sheet and some supporting pillars fell on cars and taxis lining up outside the departures lane.

The Fire Service received a call about the collapsed roof at around 5:30 am. Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu has said he is personally monitoring the situation.


Terminal 1 was expanded recently and Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the expanded version on March 11 this year. Opposition leaders hit out at Modi for insisting on inaugurating the terminal during his campaign spree, while it was still “incomplete”.




Kinjarapu responded to “clarify that the building inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi is on the other side and the building that collapsed here is an old building and was opened in 2009″, thereby trying to distance Modi from the tragedy.

Heavy rains late on Thursday night and into Friday night has left Delhi’s streets waterlogged and several residential areas flooded on Friday (June 28) morning.


The traffic police issued advisories because of water-logging on roads and under flyovers.


This rain comes after a long and severe heat wave in the city, which had reportedly led to at least 277 people dying in heat-related incident.

The Indian Meteorological Department said that the Safdarjung area in the city received 154 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Thursday and 5:30 am on Friday. The IMD also told people to “avoid waterlogged areas” and be careful of slippery roads.

","Back in February 2009, the then Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit inaugurated the terminal in question at the Indira Gandhi International Airport while Praful Patel was the Civil Aviation Minister.

On Friday (28th June), a roof collapsed at Terminal-1 of Delhi airport leaving one dead and six injured. Even in a situation like this, the opposition parties found an opportunity to attack the Central government.

Taking to X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that in March this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Terminal-1 of Delhi Airport the roof of which he asserted collapsed today.

“…On March 10th, when Modi ji inaugurated the Delhi Ariport T1, he called himself“Doosri mitti ka insaan…” All this false bravado and rhetoric was only reserved for quickly indulging in ribbon-cutting ceremonies before Elections! Our heartfelt condolences to the victims of the Delhi airport tragedy. They bore the brunt of a Corrupt, Inept and Selfish Govt,” Kharge wrote.


Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also quick to blame PM Modi as she wrote, “Delhi Airport Terminal-1, which was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in March, suffered a roof collapse today, resulting in the tragic death of a cab driver…This is BJP’s corrupt model of “take donation and give business” which has now been exposed. The question is, will the Chief Inauguration Minister take responsibility for this poor construction work and this corrupt model?”


Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress spokesperson Riju Dutta used the incident to attack PM Modi and claimed that PM Modi hurriedly inaugurated Terminal-1 of Delhi Airport for election campaigning. She alleged that PM Modi is “directly responsible” for the death of three people in the roof collapse.

“Roof collapse in Delhi Terminal 1 Airport departure area. 3 Dead including a cab driver in pillar collapse, at least 6 injuries. Tragedy & national shame. Flights suspended. For election campaigning, PM Modi had hurriedly “inaugurated” T1 in March even while it was under construction. From Jabalpur Airport to Ayodhya Station to now New Delhi Airport, “Photojeevi” PM’s desperation to inaugurate projects before completion for political mileage is the fundamental reason for such tragedies. He’s directly responsible for the death of 3 people who lost their lives because PM Modi was desperate to campaign,” Dutta posted.


Tamil Nadu Congress general secretary Laksmi Ramachandran claimed that the Delhi Airport is not an old one but rather “just inaugurated”. “OMG….Airport roof falling? It is not even an old airport, just inaugurated one! When will we wake up? This is what monopoly leads to….3 lives lost,” she posted.


Was Delhi Airport’s Terminal-1 inaugurated by PM Modi three months ago?
Amidst the political blame game started by the opposition parties, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidr said that the building that collapsed here is an old building and was inaugurated back in 2009.

“…we are taking this incident seriously…I want to clarify that the building inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi is on the other side and the building that collapsed here is an old building and was opened in 2009…” the Minister said.


Notably, back in February 2009, the then Delhi Chief Minister and Congress leader Sheila Dikshit inaugurated the terminal in question at the Indira Gandhi International Airport when Praful Patel was the Civil Aviation Minister.

",,,"Roof Collapse at Delhi Airport Terminal 1 Leaves One Dead, Several Injured

","On the morning of June 28, a tragic incident occurred at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport when a section of the roof at Terminal 1 collapsed, leading to the death of a taxi driver and injuring several others. The collapse prompted the closure of check-in counters due to safety concerns and led to the cancellation of all departing flights until 1 pm. The incident also caused significant traffic disruptions in the area surrounding the airport.

The collapse involved a roof sheet and supporting pillars, which fell onto cars and taxis outside the departures lane. The Fire Service received an emergency call about the incident at approximately 5:30 am. In response, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu stated that he was personally overseeing the situation.

The terminal where the collapse occurred has been a focal point of recent developments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated an expanded section of Terminal 1 on March 11 this year. However, following the roof collapse, opposition leaders have criticized the timing of the inauguration, suggesting it was rushed for political reasons.

In response to the criticisms, Civil Aviation Minister Naidu clarified that the section of the terminal that was inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi is located on the opposite side of the terminal complex and that the building involved in the collapse dates back to 2009. This statement aimed to distance the Prime Minister from the tragic event, focusing attention on the older structure that was involved.

The incident occurred after heavy rains lashed Delhi late on Thursday night, continuing into Friday morning. The rains led to widespread waterlogging across the city, including under flyovers and on major roads, complicating the situation further. The Indian Meteorological Department reported that the Safdarjung area received 154 mm of rainfall between 8:30 am on Thursday and 5:30 am on Friday. The department advised residents to avoid waterlogged areas and to exercise caution on slippery roads.

The recent rain comes after a severe heatwave in the city, which had already claimed the lives of at least 277 people. The combination of extreme weather events has placed additional stress on the city’s infrastructure and emergency services.

The incident at the airport has sparked a broader political debate, with opposition leaders using the opportunity to criticize the government’s handling of infrastructure projects and the timing of inaugurations. The ruling party, in turn, has attempted to clarify the situation by emphasizing the distinction between the newly inaugurated section of the terminal and the older structure that was involved in the collapse.

As investigations into the cause of the collapse continue, the focus remains on ensuring the safety of the airport's infrastructure and addressing the concerns raised by the incident. The tragedy has underscored the importance of rigorous safety checks and the challenges posed by extreme weather conditions in maintaining public infrastructure.

https://thewire.in/politics/modis-boast-about-giving-70-muslim-obc-groups-reservation-in-gujarat-as-cm-comes-back-to-haunt-him,Modi’s Boast About 'Giving 70 Muslim OBC Groups Reservation in Gujarat as CM' Comes Back to Haunt Him,"Three reasons why BJP’s shrill pitch against Muslim reservations is not only based on untruths but also hypocritical and not politically savvy.

Modi’s Boast About 'Giving 70 Muslim OBC Groups Reservation in Gujarat as CM' Comes Back to Haunt Him

“Among Muslims in Gujarat, there are 70 groups, who are OBC. When I was in Gujarat, they used to get benefits in the OBC category “

– Narendra Modi on February 9, 2022

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been on a hate-speech spree since his outing in Rajasthan’s Banswada, first on “redistribution”, telling those assembled that their “mangalsutras” and few resources “hidden in bajra cans” will be taken away by the Congress and “redistributed” to “Musalmaan” or “those who have more children,” and who are “infiltrators”.


But subsequently, when a distinct impression gained momentum that the BJP wants “400 seats” to scrap reservations, the party has stopped using the slogan and also tried to cap its several leaders from saying they want to change the Constitution. Modi’s speeches too have taken to spreading a different kind of misinformation about the Congress manifesto. He and other top leaders of the BJP are officially saying that the Congress wants to “take away reservation from SC/ST/OBCs” and “give it to Muslims.”

But even this has political costs for the BJP, ruling with a majority for ten years now.

Any hopes that Modi and the BJP had with the talk of “Muslim outreach,” emphasised by the party, particularly focusing on ‘triple talaq’ as a means to dilute Muslim concerns to take away the edge from sections of the population that are determined to oppose the BJP, would have vanished after the spree of open Islamophobia.

But there are three aspects on which the reservation talk on Muslims is backfiring and embarrassing the BJP.

Firstly, Modi himself has been keen to take credit for providing reservation for backward Muslims. In an interview to ANI two years ago, he applauded himself forgiving them benefits. He had said: “Among Muslims in Gujarat, there are 70 groups, who are OBC. When I was in Gujarat, they used to get benefits in the OBC category.” (Watch the video at 28:40). All allegations against the Congress leadership nationally or in states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana fall flat with Congress leaders pointing out to his own comments and claims about ensuring backward Muslims get their due via reservations.

Second, his own allies in the NDA, JD(S)’s H.D. Deve Gowda, were claiming credit for ensuring that Muslim backwards got the reservation benefits due to them when Gowda was chief minister of Karnataka, taking away from Modi trying to paint Karnataka’s Congress dispensation into a corner by portraying them as pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu. But Mysore, the princely state has been a pioneer in introducing reservation towards fair representation and social justice.

“The first ever order for affirmative action was issued in 1874 and it included Muslims.” This followed the first ever census conducted in India in 1872 which “revealed a preponderance of Brahmins in public services, to correct which the first order introducing reservation was introduced in 1874 in Mysore state, restricting it to only the Police Department.” In their present form, reservations for Muslim backwards are at least 20 years old.

When BJP’s Basavaraj Bommai was chief minister of the state, he scrapped the reservation benefits for backward Muslims, till he was ordered by the Supreme Court to reinstate the provision.

On April 25, 2023, Karnataka chief minister Bommai’s counsel told the Supreme Court that the state government will not implement its decision to scrap 4% reservation for Muslims in the 2B category of the ‘Other Backward Castes’ till the hearing in the top court is completed.

BJP’s ally in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu has promised to preserve the 4% reservations to Muslims under the OBC category in Andhra Pradesh, if the TDP-JSP-BJP alliance is elected to power. He did this as recently as on May 2 (Thursday), while addressing a Praja Galam public meeting. Naidu, reports The Hindu, said that advocates would be engaged to get the case resolved in the Supreme Court.

“Interests of the Muslims will be safeguarded by rejuvenating welfare schemes meant for them,” he said.

Third, all talk of ‘Pasmanda’ Muslims, which has been used to drive a wedge in the idea of a consolidated Muslim vote, was important in states like Bihar and particularly pushed there. Dainik Jagran even did an ‘inside story’ on November 23, 2022, on the planning by the BJP to cleave backward Muslim votes off from the Mahagathbandhan for itself. But, now, with this wholesale attack personally by Modi on the idea of reservation for Muslim backwards has further compounded alienation from the BJP. Their votes may not matter or be needed by the BJP, but their political actions do have consequences.

In India, reservations are given, flowing from Article 15(4) and 16(4) for backwardness irrespective of religion.

Subsequently, during Modi's tenure as CM, 14 castes and some sects were appended to the list, none of which pertained to Muslims.
As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections are underway, the Congress trolls on social media are hyperactively spreading fake news and disinformation in the forlorn hope of tipping the scales in favour of their party, whose leaders appear resigned to the fact that Modi’s return to power is all but inevitable. 

In an attempt to reverse the fortunes of the Congress party, its online supporters and trolls have started claiming that Modi granted reservations to Muslim castes during his tenure as Gujarat CM. 

The claims have spawned on social media after PM Modi asserted that Congress tried to grant reservation to Muslims at the expense of SC/ST castes. Addressing the electorate in Rajasthan’s Tonk-Sawai Madhopur Lok Sabha constituency, slated to cast their votes on April 26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remarked on Tuesday that in 2004, the Congress attempted to allocate reservations to Muslims in Andhra Pradesh at the expense of diminishing SC/ST reservations, displaying what he described as a disregard for the Constitution.

“The reality is that during the Congress regime, they sought to carve out a separate reservation for their favoured voting bloc by encroaching upon the reservations meant for Dalits and backward classes. This action, he emphasised, stands in stark contradiction to the principles outlined in the Constitution,” PM Modi said. 

No sooner did Modi accuse Congress of minority appeasement by granting reservations to Muslims by encroaching upon quota meant for SC/ST castes than a raft of Congress trolls online began sharing an incomplete video to insinuate that Modi accorded reservation to Muslim castes during his tenure as the Gujarat CM. 



Congress trolls share an incomplete video of Modi to make misleading claims: Modi doesn’t claim to extend reservations to Muslim castes in the state list
Firstly, in the video, Modi isn’t making such assertions; rather, he mentions that during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, numerous Muslim castes benefited from reservations under the OBC quota. However, he notes that the media often overlooks such instances. Nowhere does Modi claim that his administration included any Muslim caste in the state’s OBC list.

It is indeed a fact that numerous “Muslim castes” have been receiving reservations under OBC quotas across various states for nearly four decades. Muslim castes were also granted reservations in the central OBC quota, with the UPA government issuing notifications to this effect. This practice predates Modi’s tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat.

Curiously, upon examining the castes enumerated in Gujarat’s state OBC list, it becomes apparent that all the Muslim castes that were included in the list were before Narendra Modi assumed office as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Subsequently, during Modi’s tenure as CM, 14 castes and some sects were appended to the list, none of which pertained to Muslims.


Notifications issued by successive Gujarat govts to extend reservations to various caste groups
Modi took the oath of Gujarat CM on 7 October 2001 and was the chief minister of the state till 2014. As per the List of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes declared by Gujarat State, there were 7 instances when the state government intervened to add castes to the existing list.

These include Kamli, Tamboli, Garai, Gurav, Kalal (Hindu), Sanghar (Hindu), Nagarchi, Kayasth, Gandharv (Hindu), Darji, Bhandari, Kathi Rajgir and Ahir Gor, Kuruhin Shetty, and Hajari (Rajput). 


Castes included in reservations under Modi as Gujarat CM
Kalal Muslims were already included in caste reservations; Kalal Hindus were included in reservations under Modi as Gujarat’s CM
Indeed, a noteworthy instance arises with the Kalal caste of Gujarat. While both Hindus and Muslims are recognised as belonging to this caste, only Muslim Kalals were granted reservation and incorporated into the OBC list by the Gujarat government. It wasn’t until 2005, under the Modi administration, that Hindu Kalals were eventually included in the list.

Interestingly, there are 31 Muslim castes granted reservations by the Gujarat government. Out of 31, 29 Muslim castes were granted reservations under the Congress-led governments in the state. There were two instances when Muslim castes were included in the ambit of reservations under BJP-led governments, one in December 1995 and the other one in September 1996, but Modi was not at the helm of the government then. 


",,,The Debate on Muslim Reservations in India’s Political Landscape,"As India prepares for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the issue of reservations for Muslims within the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category has once again become a focal point in the political discourse. The debate has seen various claims and counterclaims from both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition, particularly the Congress, leading to a complex narrative that touches upon historical decisions, constitutional principles, and electoral strategies.

The controversy gained momentum when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a campaign rally in Rajasthan’s Tonk-Sawai Madhopur constituency, accused the Congress of attempting to grant reservations to Muslims at the expense of the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Modi’s remarks, aimed at highlighting what he termed as the Congress’s disregard for constitutional principles, sparked a wave of responses from Congress leaders and supporters, who, in turn, pointed to Modi’s past statements on Muslim reservations.

In February 2022, Modi, in an interview with ANI, had mentioned that during his tenure as Gujarat Chief Minister, “70 groups among Muslims” received benefits under the OBC category. This statement has since been scrutinized, with some interpreting it as an acknowledgment of Modi’s support for Muslim reservations, while others argue that the inclusion of Muslim castes in the OBC list predated his tenure.

Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that most of the Muslim castes included in Gujarat’s OBC list were added before Modi assumed office as Chief Minister in 2001. During his tenure, while several castes were added to the list, none of them were Muslim. This fact has been used by BJP supporters to counter claims that Modi played a significant role in extending reservations to Muslims during his time as Gujarat CM.

The issue of Muslim reservations is not confined to Gujarat alone. Across various states, including Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the question of whether Muslims should receive OBC status has been a contentious topic. In Karnataka, for instance, former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s decision to scrap 4% reservation for Muslims in the 2B category was met with legal challenges, leading to a Supreme Court intervention that temporarily halted the implementation of the decision.

Meanwhile, in Andhra Pradesh, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), an ally of the BJP, has promised to preserve the 4% reservations for Muslims under the OBC category if elected to power. TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s recent statements emphasize the party’s commitment to safeguarding the interests of Muslims, a stance that seems to diverge from the broader narrative being pushed by the BJP at the national level.

The debate also touches upon the historical context of reservations in India. The practice of granting reservations based on backwardness, regardless of religion, stems from Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Indian Constitution. In states like Karnataka, reservations for Muslim backward classes have been in place for decades, with roots tracing back to the 19th century when the princely state of Mysore first introduced affirmative action measures.

In the current political climate, the issue of Muslim reservations has become a double-edged sword for the BJP. On one hand, the party has sought to distance itself from policies perceived as favoring Muslims, in line with its broader electoral strategy. On the other hand, past statements by Modi and the actions of BJP-led governments at the state level have created a narrative that complicates this stance, leading to accusations of hypocrisy and political opportunism from the opposition.

As the debate continues, the question of how to balance the demands for social justice with the principles of secularism and constitutional integrity remains a central challenge for India’s political leadership. The upcoming elections will likely see further discussions on this issue, as parties across the spectrum seek to navigate the complex landscape of caste, religion, and electoral politics.

https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/preaching-consensus-provoking-confrontation/article68343827.ece,"Preaching consensus, provoking confrontation","There is no evidence that the Prime Minister has come to terms with the electoral outcome or has reflected on the message sent to him by voters, writes Sonia Gandhi. On June 4, 2024, the verdict of our country’s electorate was delivered clearly and resoundingly. It signalled a personal, political, and moral defeat for a Prime Minister who had awarded himself a divine status during the campaign. The verdict negated not only such pretensions, but it was also an unequivocal rejection of the politics of divisiveness, discord and hatred, a repudiation of both the substance and style of governance of Mr. Narendra Modi.


The fading of accommodation
Yet, the Prime Minister continues as if nothing has changed. He preaches the value of consensus but continues to value confrontation. There is not the slightest evidence that he has come to terms with the electoral outcome, or understood the verdict and has reflected on the message sent to him by millions of voters. The first few days of the 18th Lok Sabha have sadly been far from encouraging. Any hope that we might see a changed attitude has been dashed. Any hope that a new spirit of mutual respect and accommodation, let alone camaraderie would be fostered, has been belied.

I would like to remind readers what the INDIA bloc parties told the Prime Minister when his emissaries sought unanimity for the post of Speaker. The response was simple and straightforward: we said that we would support the government — but in keeping with convention and tradition, it was only fair and to be expected that the post of Deputy Speaker would be given to a member from the ranks of the Opposition. This perfectly reasonable request was found unacceptable by a regime that, it bears recall, had not filled the Constitutional position of Deputy Speaker in the 17th Lok Sabha.

And then, the Emergency was dredged up by the Prime Minister and his party – astonishingly, even by the Speaker whose position is incompatible with any public political stance other than one of strict impartiality. This attempt to divert attention away from the assault on the Constitution, on its foundational principles and values, on the institutions it has created and empowered, does not augur well for the smooth functioning of Parliament.

It is a fact of history that in March 1977 the people of our country gave a categorical verdict on the Emergency, which was accepted unhesitatingly and unequivocally. That less than three years later the party that was humbled in March 1977 was returned to power, with a majority never achieved by Mr. Modi and his party, is also very much part of that history.

Issues that need extensive debate
We need to look ahead. The bizarre and unprecedented suspension of 146 Members of Parliament, who were legitimately demanding a discussion on a deplorable breach of Parliament’s security, was clearly a way of ensuring that three far-reaching criminal justice laws could be passed without any discussion. Several legal experts and many others have expressed grave concerns about these laws. Should these laws not be kept in abeyance till they have undergone fuller Parliamentary scrutiny in keeping with accepted parliamentary practice and especially since the electoral verdict of 2024? Similarly, amendments to forest conservation and biological diversity protection forest laws were pushed through last year when there was uproar and chaos in Parliament. An ecological and humanitarian disaster is awaiting us as the Great Nicobar project is pushed through. Should they also not be revisited to give meaning to the Prime Minister’s stated desire for consensus and for passage of laws after full debate and discussion?


On the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) scandal that has wreaked havoc on the lives of lakhs of our youth, the immediate response of the Education Minister was to deny the magnitude of what has happened. The Prime Minister who does his ‘Pariksha pe Charcha’ has been conspicuously silent on the leaks that have devastated so many families across the country. The inevitable ‘high power committees’ have been constituted but the real issue is how the professionalism of educational institutions such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training, the University Grants Commission and universities themselves have been so deeply damaged in the last 10 years.

Meanwhile, the campaign of violence and intimidation against India’s minorities has once again intensified. In the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States, bulldozers are again demolishing the homes of minorities based on mere allegations, violating due process, and inflicting collective punishment. None of this is surprising given the communal invective and blatant falsehoods that the Prime Minister inflicted on the people during the election campaign. He provocatively escalated the rhetoric out of fear that the election was slipping away from him, showing complete disregard for the dignity and maryada of his position.

In February 2022, the BJP and its allies got a convincing majority in the assembly elections in Manipur. Yet, within 15 months Manipur began to burn—or should it be said was allowed to begin to burn. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands dislocated. Social harmony in this most sensitive state has been shattered. Yet, the Prime Minister has not found either the time or the inclination to visit the State nor to meet with its political leaders. It is no wonder that his party has lost both the Lok Sabha seats there, but this does not seem to have had any impact on his most insensitive handling of the crisis that has engulfed Manipur’s variegated society.


The Prime Minister diminished himself by the campaign he ran for over forty days. His words did untold damage to our social fabric and to the dignity of the office he is privileged to hold. It is for him to reflect and introspect and recognise that in rejecting his call for 400-plus parliamentary seats, crores of our people – to whom he promises sabka saath, sabka vikas — sent a powerful message, that they had had enough.

The Opposition will reflect India’s voice
The INDIA bloc parties have made it clear that they do not seek a confrontationist attitude. The Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi has offered cooperation. The leaders of the constituents of the alliance have made clear that they are looking to being productive in Parliament and to impartiality in the conduct of its proceedings. It is our hope that the Prime Minister and his government will respond positively. The initial evidence does not augur well, but we in the Opposition are committed to restoring balance and productivity in Parliament, to ensure that the voice of the millions who have sent us there as their representatives is heard and their concerns are raised and addressed. We live in hope that the Treasury benches will step forward so that we can fulfil our democratic duties.",https://zeenews.india.com/video/news/taal-thok-ke-bulldozer-has-your-religion-changed-2761825.html,Taal Thok Ke: 'Bulldozer'.. has your religion changed?,"Taal Thok Ke: Congress Parliamentary Party President and Rajya Sabha MP Sonia Gandhi has strongly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an article. She has alleged that PM Modi says one thing and does another. Taking her allegations forward, she said that Modi preaches consensus but promotes confrontation. But the issue on which Sonia has cornered the Modi government in her article is the bulldozer action. She alleged that after the formation of the Modi government for the third time, the campaign of violence and intimidation against minorities has once again intensified. Sonia alleged that in BJP-ruled states, bulldozers are again demolishing the houses of minorities on the basis of mere allegations. She has alleged violation of due process in the bulldozer action and said that collective punishment is being given on the basis of religion. Sonia Gandhi also made serious allegations against PM Modi of raising communal issues and lying during the election campaign. She said that in view of this, the bulldozer action being taken on religious grounds is not surprising. Sonia has also written that PM Modi made communal statements in a provocative manner due to fear of defeat in the elections. And by doing so, he completely ignored the dignity and decorum of his post. It is worth noting that in his article, he has only written about minorities. He has not mentioned any particular religion. Sonia has described the election results as PM Modi's personal, political and moral defeat. And claimed that the mandate has rejected all the claims of Modi and also rejected the politics of division, discord and hatred. This article of Sonia has raised the political temperature. BJP is retaliating.",,,"The Ongoing Debate Over Prime Minister Modi’s Leadership and Governance

","The political landscape in India remains charged with debate as the country navigates through the aftermath of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. At the center of the discourse is Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose leadership and governance continue to draw both criticism and support from different quarters. The recent exchange of views between political leaders has further highlighted the deep divisions within the nation’s political fabric.

In a strongly worded article, Congress Parliamentary Party President Sonia Gandhi has launched a scathing critique of Prime Minister Modi, accusing him of disregarding the electoral verdict and continuing with a confrontational style of governance. Gandhi’s article reflects a deep dissatisfaction with the current administration, highlighting concerns over the treatment of minorities, the use of bulldozer actions in BJP-ruled states, and the overall direction of the Modi government.

According to Gandhi, the 2024 election results signified a rejection of Modi’s politics of divisiveness and hatred. She argues that the Prime Minister has failed to acknowledge the message sent by the voters, continuing instead with policies and actions that she believes undermine the principles of democracy and constitutional governance. Gandhi specifically points to the suspension of 146 Members of Parliament and the passage of controversial laws without adequate debate as examples of the government’s disregard for parliamentary norms.

The issue of bulldozer actions, where homes of minorities have been demolished based on allegations without due process, is a central theme in Gandhi’s critique. She accuses the Modi government of intensifying violence and intimidation against minorities, a charge that has been met with strong reactions from BJP supporters. Gandhi also raises concerns about the handling of the NEET scandal, the crisis in Manipur, and the amendments to forest conservation laws, arguing that these issues have been mishandled by the government.

On the other side of the political spectrum, supporters of Prime Minister Modi have dismissed Gandhi’s criticisms as politically motivated. They argue that the Prime Minister’s actions are in line with his commitment to law and order and that the bulldozer actions are a necessary response to illegal activities. BJP leaders have also pointed to Modi’s past statements about supporting OBC reservations for certain Muslim groups as evidence of his inclusive approach, although this interpretation is contested.

The debate over Modi’s leadership is not just about policy disagreements but also about the broader direction of India’s democracy. The Congress party, under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, has positioned itself as a defender of democratic norms and constitutional values, calling for greater scrutiny of government actions and a more inclusive approach to governance. The INDIA bloc, a coalition of opposition parties, has pledged to work towards restoring balance and productivity in Parliament, with a focus on addressing the concerns of all citizens.

As India moves forward, the question of how to reconcile these differing visions of governance will remain a central challenge. The 2024 election results, while a clear victory for the BJP, have also exposed deep divisions within the country. The ongoing debate between the ruling party and the opposition highlights the need for a more inclusive and transparent political process, one that can address the concerns of all citizens and uphold the principles of democracy.

In the coming months, the Modi government will face the challenge of responding to these criticisms while continuing to pursue its policy agenda. Whether it can do so in a way that fosters greater consensus and inclusivity will be a key test of its leadership. For now, the political temperature in India remains high, with both sides preparing for the next phase of this ongoing debate.

Comedian Daniel Fernandes on Saturday cancelled a stand-up performance in Telangana’s Hyderabad after receiving threats from a BJP MLA about a joke he had made about the Jain community.

In a clip from a performance he had posted on social media, Fernandes had made a joke about some members of the Jain community who disguised themselves as Muslims to buy goats in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk ahead of the Muslim festival of Bakra Eid.

According to a report by The Print, some members of the Jain community had paid Rs 15 lakh to buy 124 goats to “save” them from being slaughtered.

Within hours of the video being posted, Fernandes’ Instagram post was filled with angry comments. On Friday, he posted a statement on Instagram saying he would remove the joke.

On Saturday, Bharatiya Janata Party leader T Raja Singh from Hyderabad said in a video that if Fernandes did not cancel the show, “our workers will come there and thrash you”.

Singh, the MLA from the Goshamahal constituency, also urged the Hyderabad Police to cancel the comedian’s show. “If not, everyone will remember the state we will make of him so that no one will ever make a joke on the Jain community or Hinduism,” he said.

Fernandes apologised to the Jain community and said that he had received several “abusive and threatening” messages after he initially posted the video.

“As comedians, we are aware that once in a while something we say may not be received well,” he said in a post. “It’s the nature of the business. It’s impossible to make everyone laugh.”

Fernandes said that there was “no malice” involved in his writing process, adding that comedy should bring people together rather than drive them apart.

“My intention with my craft has always been only to entertain, and while lot of my fans have enjoyed this particular video, it is also possible that people may have felt genuinely hurt,” he said.


Later in the day, in a video on social media, he said that the video on the joke had been taken down and an apology had been issued. He added that the show in Hyderabad had to be “rescheduled because of the unrest caused” by the comedy sketch.

“However, we are still receiving calls, messages, and emails threatening us with violence and vandalism,” Fernandes said. “Nobody is ready to guarantee the safety of my audience, my crew and myself. I do not want to put anyone in harm’s way because of something I said.”

He said that it was all right to disagree with the work of an artist. However, to threaten violence was not an answer, the comedian added.

In January, BJP MLA T Raja Singh had been booked by the Maharashtra Police for making incendiary speeches at a rally in Maharashtra’s Solapur district.

During the rally held on January 6, Singh allegedly urged the audience to assault “love jihadis” and boycott products with halal certification.

“Love jihad” is a Hindutva conspiracy theory that Muslim men lure Hindu women into romantic relationships in order to convert them to Islam. The Union home ministry has told Parliament that Indian law has no provision defining “love jihad”.

On Bakri Eid, a comedian named Daniel Fernandes cracked bad jokes and mocked the Jain community. I want to tell him to cancel his Banjara Hill show or else our workers will come there and thrash you. You will think 50 times before coming to Telangana,"" Singh said.

Comedian Daniel Fernandes, who shot to fame with his controversial comments during a stand-up targeting the Jain community for rescuing goats on Bakrid, got his show Hyderabad show, “Do You Know Who I Am?”, scheduled for 4 PM on Saturday, June 29, cancelled after Goshamahal BJP MLA T Raja Singh warned of dire consequences if he was allowed to perform at Heart Cup Coffee in Jubilee Hills.

Fernandes released a video saying that his show has been ‘rescheduled’ following outrage over his recent video. In the video, he says, “The video that offended people has been taken down, and I have posted an apology. However, we are still receiving threats of violence and vandalism. Nobody can guarantee the safety of my audience, crew, or myself. I don’t want to put anyone in harm’s way because of something I said.”

Fernandes added that while it’s okay to disagree with an artist’s work, threatening violence is not the answer. He also apologized again to the Jain community.

Following outrage over Fernandes’ video ridiculing the Jain community, which was subsequently deleted after massive backlash from the Jains, BJP MLA T Raja Singh released a video warning of dire consequences if he goes ahead with his show scheduled in Banjara Hills.

“Jai Jeenendra, Jai Siya Ram. On Bakri Eid, a comedian named Daniel Fernandes cracked bad jokes and mocked the Jain community. I want to tell him to cancel his Banjara Hill show or else our workers will come there and thrash you. You will think 50 times before coming to Telangana,” Singh said.


Requesting the police to cancel the show, Singh added, “We urge you to call off his show. If not, the state we will make of his will be remembered, so no one will ever joke about Jains or the Hindu religion,” recalling the tensions when comedian Munawar Faruqi was scheduled to perform in Hyderabad in 2022, warning the police that any unrest would be their responsibility.

For those unfamiliar, Daniel Fernandes found himself in controversy over his ‘Jains Buy Goats’ video. After the video went viral, he faced significant backlash for jokes touching on religious sentiments, particularly about the Jain and Muslim communities. In the video, Fernandes joked about Jains being involved in the meat business, leading to criticism for creating tension between the two communities.",,,Comedian Daniel Fernandes Cancels Hyderabad Show Amid Controversy Over Jain Community Joke,"Comedian Daniel Fernandes recently canceled his scheduled stand-up performance in Hyderabad following significant backlash and threats after a joke he made involving the Jain community. The controversy erupted after Fernandes posted a clip from one of his performances on social media, where he joked about some members of the Jain community disguising themselves as Muslims to buy goats in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk ahead of the Muslim festival Bakra Eid.

The joke quickly drew criticism, particularly from members of the Jain community, who were upset by the content. According to reports, the community had previously spent a substantial sum to purchase goats to prevent them from being slaughtered. Fernandes’ joke, which alluded to this act, was perceived by many as disrespectful and offensive.

The situation escalated when BJP MLA T Raja Singh from Hyderabad issued a video warning to Fernandes, urging him to cancel his show in the city. Singh, representing the Goshamahal constituency, stated that if the show went ahead, party workers would take matters into their own hands. He called on the Hyderabad Police to cancel the performance, warning that if they did not, the consequences would be severe, and the incident would serve as a deterrent to anyone making jokes about the Jain community or Hinduism in the future.

In response to the mounting pressure, Fernandes apologized to the Jain community and removed the controversial video from his social media platforms. He expressed regret, stating that while his intention was never to offend, he understood that the joke had hurt some people. He also emphasized that comedy should bring people together rather than drive them apart.

Despite his apology, the threats continued. In a later video, Fernandes announced the cancellation of his Hyderabad show, citing concerns for the safety of his audience, crew, and himself. He explained that while disagreements with an artist's work are understandable, threatening violence is not an appropriate response.

The incident has sparked a broader discussion about freedom of speech, the role of comedy in society, and the boundaries of artistic expression. Supporters of Fernandes argue that the backlash he faced is symptomatic of growing intolerance towards humor that critiques or satirizes religious and cultural practices. Meanwhile, those siding with Raja Singh believe that comedians must exercise caution and sensitivity when dealing with subjects that touch on religious sentiments.

Raja Singh's intervention in this matter is not without precedent. Earlier in January, the BJP MLA had been booked by Maharashtra Police for making incendiary remarks during a rally, where he urged the audience to take action against ""love jihadis"" and boycott products with halal certification. His current stance reflects a continuation of his hardline approach to defending what he sees as the interests of Hindu communities.

As the debate continues, the incident has underscored the complex dynamics between free expression and respect for religious sentiments in India. While comedians like Fernandes navigate the fine line between humor and offense, public figures like Singh advocate for stringent measures to protect community values. The cancellation of the Hyderabad show is a testament to the growing challenges artists face in an increasingly polarized environment.

Instead of support in this difficult time, she and many like her were subjected to unwanted advances at government offices, she says, by the officials who should have instead offered them support in this hour of crisis.


Sharing her ordeal, 60-year-old Indu, widow of Inspector Inderjeet Singh of the Border Security Force (BSF) who was killed during the war — recalls how an Uttar Pradesh (UP)-based officer at a government office in Meerut, driven with lust, had misbehaved with her.

The officer was given the task of overseeing land allotment for construction of the memorials of martyrs in their respective villages. She says the officer even touched her with his feet when she was sitting in front of him for some help in connection with the allotment.
Indu's husband, Inderjeet Singh of the 129 Battalion of the BSF, was killed on June 28, 1999, when he and his team came under heavy fire by terrorists in the Kupwara sector, 6km from Halmatpora forest in Jammu and Kashmir.

Singh's team of six had cordoned off the area where 40 terrorists were holed up. Eventually, the BSF was able to kill four of those terrorists. During the Kargil War, BSF personnel were deployed in sensitive areas along the LoC to assist the Indian Army battling in Kargil.

""It was a very dangerous operation,"" Indu recalls. Besides Singh, two others lost their lives, including another senior officer and second-in-command Satpal Chaudhary of Yamunanagar.

Singh, who had joined the BSF in 1988, was conferred with the President's Police Medal (Gallantry) for his brave actions.

The Kargil War was fought between India and Pakistan from May to July 1999 in J&K's Kargil district and other areas along the the Line of Control. It officially ended on July 26 that year with Pakistan's defeat.

Indu, originally from Baghpat, UP but now settled in Rohtak city of Haryana, says she was not the only one subjected to such harassment.

Following the officer's inappropriate actions and hearing stories from other war widows about officers' demeaning attitude towards them, Indu says she decided to approach the then Union home minister LK Advani in 2001 to complain against the officer. It was after Advani’s intervention that the officer was suspended.


This wasn't the only incident. Recalling a visit to an LIC office to enquire about her husband's policies, she says an employee ""misbehaved"" with her there too.

“Mine was not an isolated case. Forcing widows to sit close to them, asking them to stay till odd hours and talking with double meaning were common occurrences, which I and others faced during the initial days of widowhood,"" she says.

""I was educated and objected to the act on every occasion, but the majority of young widows, who were illiterate and from rural areas without any exposure to the outside world, were harassed,” says Indu, who is a postgraduate.

It wasn't just this harassment she had to deal with, Indu also faced difficulties at home. She says she was unable to survive in her late husband’s joint family setup in Baghpat where she was pressured for “Rupya” (a custom to get married to a brother of the late husband).

At the time, her two sons Prashant and Bhanu were seven and five, respectively.

Indu refused to follow this custom; instead she told her in-laws and her family that she would live the rest of her life with the memories of her brave husband who had laid down his life for the country.

She then left Baghpat and decided to settle in Rohtak with the help of some relatives there.

As the kin of a martyr, Indu was entitled to allottment a petrol pump as per the government's policy for Kargil widows. After a long struggle that involved her shuttling from the offices of the state government and the Union ministry of home affairs to the Indian Oil Corporation, her battle finally ended in 2007 when she was allotted a pump in Rohtak city.

While visiting these offices, she encountered several officials who considered widows ""easy targets to satisfy their physical lust"". “I witnessed a complete lapse of morality during the initial days of widowhood,” Indu says.

After many years of struggle as a single parent raising two children, Indu says she now has stability in her life. Currently settled in an upscale residential area of Rohtak, Indu runs the petrol pump allotted by the government along with her two sons. She also visits Baghpat every year to perform havan at the native place of her husband.",https://www.opindia.com/2024/06/times-of-india-clickbait-headline-indian-army-sexual-harassment-insinuations-kargil-war-widow-exposed/,"The Times of India insinuates that Indian army officers asked for ‘sexual favours’ from Kargil war widows, changes clickbait headline after outrage","The accusations of sexual harassment levelled by wife of Kargil war martyr Indu Singh were directed towards State government officials and not officers in the Indian army.

On Thursday (27th June), ‘The Times of India’ suggested that Indian army officers had sought sexual favours from the wives of soldiers, who were martyred during the Kargil War of 1999.


The popular Indian English daily made such an insinuation through an article’s clickbait headline, which goes as ‘We Kargil widows “were easy targets for officers to satisfy lust”.’

The cunning choice of words, in the headline, suggested that widows of fallen soldiers of the Kargil War were somehow preyed upon by officers within the Indian army to satisfy their lust.


Screengrab of the controversial headline by The Times of India
However, a thorough reading of the article makes it clear that those who solicited sexual favours from the victims were not army officers but employees at government offices.

According to The Times of India, a 60-year-old woman named Indu Singh faced harassment and unwanted sexual advances at government offices for several years instead of support during crisis.

She is the widow of martyred Border Security Force (BSF) Inspector Inderjeet Singh. Singh informed that a government officer in Meerut, had misbehaved with her, out of lust. The accused had even inappropriately touched her with his feet.

Govt officer suspended after intervention of LK Advani
“The officer was given the task of overseeing land allotment for construction of the memorials of martyrs in their respective villages. She says the officer even touched her with his feet when she was sitting in front of him for some help in connection with the allotment,” the report added.

As per the English daily, the said officer was suspended after Indu Singh approached the then Union Home Minister LK Advani in 2001.

The report by The Times of India added, “Following the officer’s inappropriate actions and hearing stories from other war widows about officers’ demeaning attitude towards them, Indu says she decided to approach the then Union home minister LK Advani in 2001 to complain against the officer. It was after Advani’s intervention that the officer was suspended.”

Not an isolated case: Indu Singh
Indu Singh also narrated another incident where an officer at government-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) misbehaved with her as well.

The sexual advances made by officers at government offices included double meaning talks, forcing widows to sit next to them or making them stay late.

She told the Indian English daily, “I was educated and objected to the act on every occasion, but the majority of young widows, who were illiterate and from rural areas without any exposure to the outside world, were harassed.


According to Indu Singh, the government officers regarded widows as “easy targets”. She told The Times of India, “I witnessed a complete lapse of morality during the initial days of widowhood.”

The Times of India changes headline after outrage
As evident from the content of the article, the accusations of sexual harassment levelled by wife of Kargil war martyr Indu Singh were directed towards State government officials and not officers in the Indian army.

However, The Times of India chose to mislead its readers into believing otherwise especially those who may not have the patience to read the article in its entireity. Following social media outrage, the Indian English daily was forced to change its headline.

“We Kargil widows “were easy targets of govt officers’ unwanted advances”,” the new headline of the article read.


While there is no dearth of clickbait articles in Indian media sphere, it was disappointing to see a prominent English daily resort to misleading tactics to grab eyeballs.

",,,"Widow of Kargil War Hero Faces Years of Harassment by Government Officials

","Indu Singh, widow of Border Security Force (BSF) Inspector Inderjeet Singh, who was martyred during the Kargil War, has shared her harrowing experience of harassment at the hands of government officials over the years. Instead of receiving support following her husband's death, Singh, like many other war widows, encountered unwanted advances and inappropriate behavior from officials responsible for assisting them during their time of need.

Inderjeet Singh was killed in action on June 28, 1999, during a dangerous operation in the Kupwara sector of Jammu and Kashmir. His team, part of the BSF's 129 Battalion, was engaged in a fierce encounter with terrorists. Despite the challenges, the BSF successfully neutralized several terrorists, but Singh and two other officers lost their lives. For his bravery, Inderjeet Singh was posthumously awarded the President's Police Medal for Gallantry.

Following her husband's death, Indu Singh was left to navigate the complexities of life as a widow and single parent, raising her two young sons. However, her grief was compounded by the inappropriate behavior she encountered at government offices while seeking assistance. In one particularly disturbing incident, a government officer in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, who was tasked with overseeing land allotment for the construction of memorials for martyrs, allegedly made unwanted advances towards her. Singh recalls that the officer even went as far as to touch her inappropriately with his feet during a meeting.

Distressed by the officer's conduct and after hearing similar stories from other war widows, Indu Singh decided to take action. In 2001, she approached the then Union Home Minister LK Advani to report the incident. Following Advani’s intervention, the officer in question was suspended. Singh’s case, however, was not an isolated one. She recounted another incident where she was similarly mistreated at a Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) office while inquiring about her husband's policies.

Indu Singh's experiences highlight the widespread issue of harassment faced by many war widows in India. She explained that many officials viewed widows as ""easy targets"" for exploitation, particularly those who were young, illiterate, or from rural areas. Singh, who holds a postgraduate degree, was able to resist and object to these advances, but she expressed concern for others who were less equipped to defend themselves.

In addition to the harassment she faced from government officials, Indu Singh also encountered challenges within her own family. After her husband's death, she was pressured by her in-laws to remarry within the family, a practice known as ""Rupya."" However, she refused and chose to live independently, eventually settling in Rohtak, Haryana, with the help of relatives.

Despite the difficulties, Indu Singh persevered. After years of battling bureaucracy, she was eventually allotted a petrol pump in Rohtak as part of the government's support for Kargil widows. She now runs the pump alongside her two sons and has managed to achieve some stability in her life. Singh continues to honor her late husband's memory by visiting his native place in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, every year to perform religious rituals.

Indu Singh's story sheds light on the plight of war widows in India and the challenges they face, not only in coping with the loss of their loved ones but also in dealing with a system that often fails to protect and support them. Her courage in speaking out against the harassment she endured has brought attention to the need for greater accountability and support for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.

He promises to fulfill Congress manifesto, uplift the poor, and introduce schemes for youth and farmers. INDORE/KHARGONE: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that the party will remove 50% reservation ceiling in govt jobs if it forms the govt, and increase it to a level that ""meets the requirements of tribals, SC/ST, OBC and poor"". ""BJP leaders say they will snatch the rights of reservation from tribals, Dalits, OBCs. We are going to increase the 50% reservation ceiling. The court has set a limit of 50% on reservation that we will do away with and will give tribals, Dalits, OBCs and poor the reservation they require,"" Rahul said at public meetings in Alirajpur's Jobat and Khargone's Segaon town. With a copy of the Constitution in his hand, Rahul said, ""This election aims to save the constitution that BJP and RSS want to change. Congress party and INDIA bloc are trying to save this Constitution, which has given the tribal, Dalit and deprived people of the country their rights including that of Jal, Jungle, Jameen."" ""BJP leaders have made it clear that if they win the election, they will change this book (Constitution) and do away with it. Therefore, they have given the slogan of '400 paar' (400-plus seats),"" the Wayanad MP said, adding, ""They (BJP) won't even win 150 seats, let alone 400 seats"". This election is fight to restore rights of OBC, STs, SCs: Rahul He alleged that rights of tribals are being snatched away. ""Congress wants to increase their participation in all sectors, which is why we demand caste-based census and economic survey,"" he added. Rahul assured that Congress will fulfil its manifesto promises - Mahalaxmi Yojana to uplift poor families above poverty level, waiver of agriculture loans of all farmers along, ensuring jobs for youngsters and increasing wages under MGNREGA scheme. ""The poor, farmers and labourers will get the same amount of money that the PM has given to 22 billionaires,"" he said. He alleged that PM Narendra Modi implemented the ""wrong policies"" of demonetisation and GST to benefit billionaires, and this ruined the cotton industry and small and medium traders of the region. Modi's promise of giving jobs to 2 crore youth was false, the former Congress chief said. ""In the last 10 years, you (the people) have been given unemployment, tribals are migrating out to other states, farmers were not given the price of their crops, women were not helped, but the loan of Rs 16 lakh crore of 22 richest people was waived,"" he said. ""Congress had returned your rights to you by bringing PESA law, land acquisition and tribal bill,"" Rahul added. Rahul reiterated the Congress manifesto promise of giving Rs 1 lakh per year to one woman of every family till they rise above the poverty line. ""We are bringing 'Pehli Naukri Pakki' scheme for young graduates and diploma holders, under which every youth will get training and will also be given Rs 1 lakh per year, and will be given a permanent job on doing good work',"" Rahul said, adding that 30 lakh government posts will be filled if Congress forms the govt. ""Tribals, Dalits and backward people have no participation in the country. We want to change this. We want your people in government, media, public sector, big companies. Therefore, we have decided that we are going to conduct a caste census so that you will know what is your population and what is your participation in the country. This is a revolutionary work which will change the politics of India,"" Rahul added. Rahul also talked about doubling the income of ASHA and Anganwadi workers and increasing MNREGA wages to Rs 400 per day. ""Narendra Modi started the contract system in public sector and turned youths into bonded labourers. They were thrown out of job at one's whim, but we will end this system and give only permanent jobs,"" Rahul said, adding: ""We will make a law for MSP and give farmers fair prices.""",https://www.opindia.com/2024/06/copy-of-constitution-rahul-gandhi-flashes-was-conceptualised-by-sc-adv-gopal-sankaranarayanan/#google_vignette,Constitution copy Rahul Gandhi flashes at everyone was conceptualised by someone who was against OBC reservations: Read about SC Adv Gopal Sankaranarayanan,"The Gandhi scion has been flashing a small copy of the constitution that was conceptualized by Supreme Court advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who has spoken against OBC reservation and advocated for a complete overhaul of existing reservations.

During his election campaign and after the election results, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been alleging and furthering the unsubstantiated trope against PM Modi-led NDA government that the ‘Constitution is in danger’ and that it wants to do away with the reservations for vulnerable sections of society. The falsehood was amplified by circulating a doctored video of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. As part of his political rhetoric, he has been waving a red and black leather pocket-sized constitution copy to project himself as the saviour of the Dalits (SC), Tribals (ST), and OBC communities, and the one safeguarding their constitutionally enshrined reservations. 


Ironically, while asserting protecting the constitution and reservations, by extension, the Gandhi scion has been flashing a small copy of the constitution that was conceptualized by Supreme Court advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan who has spoken against OBC reservation as well as a complete overhaul of existing reservations. He has been demanding the introduction of a creamy layer in the SC/ST reservation and incorporating a 10% EWS reservation from the existing 50% limit.   

Notably, Lucknow-based Eastern Book Company has secured intellectual property rights for the said red-black leather-bound Constitution copy meaning the book cannot be copied by other publishers. 

One of the directors of the Eastern Book Company, Sumeet Malik told PTI that the idea of printing a court pocket edition came from Supreme Court advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who suggested that they should publish a version that fits easily in the lawyers’ court pockets. 

Now it is pertinent to note that the Supreme Court lawyer Gopal Sankaranarayanan has been speaking against the OBC reservation, particularly the inclusion of dominant communities which “discriminated against SCs and STs”. 

In an interview with a legal portal Law School Policy Review & Kautilya Society, Sankaranarayanan expressed concerns about the increasing demand for reservation by communities who didn’t face historical discrimination. He asserted that the Parliament went ‘beyond’ the balance that the Constitution intended to achieve when it extended reservations beyond the SC/ST category to include the OBC category. He argued that it was wrong to put the accused and victim in the same category noting that some of the OBC communities getting reservations are the ones who discriminated against SCs.  

Elaborating his rationale against OBC reservations, Gopal said, “Unfortunately, I believe that it went beyond that (balance intended by the Constitution) the minute we went beyond SC/ST. When we went into the entire OBC domain, we took the measures of historical discrimination, slowly, a little bit in a direction where groups that were socially fairly strong, and in large numbers, were now getting the benefits that should have gone to those who have historically discriminated. Please remember that a large number of those who are the OBCs were the ones who have discriminated against SCs, now you’re putting them both in the same benefit category effectively.” 

Additionally, he was part of the pleas that were filed in the Supreme Court demanding the introduction of a creamy layer in the SC/ST reservations. Back in 2018, a plea was filed by Samta Andolan Samiti, the umbrella body of general and OBC government employees and nine people belonging to the SC/ST community.

Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan sought the introduction of the creamy layer concept in SC/ST reservations to keep the rich among them out to ensure that the benefits go to the poor and the needy.

The counsel argued that due to the non-application of the concept of creamy layer in SCs and STs, the actually backward and deprived members of the SCs and STs are having a “heart burning” that uplifted/affluent and advanced portion of castes included in SCs and STs are taking away the benefits, which are designed for them.

Last year, he appeared in the Supreme Court to challenge the EWS reservation. Elaborating his opposition to the EWS reservations, he told the legal portal, “I was fine with saying EWS is good, but nuance it by saying that it is limited to 50% and doesn’t allow them to cross the 50% limit.” 

In a glaring irony, while the Supreme Court lawyer has been advocating for limiting reservations to a 50% cap, Rahul Gandhi, who has been declaring his intent to breach this limit and raising slogans such as ‘Jitni Aabadi Utna Haq,’ has been brandishing a copy of the Constitution conceptualized by the former.


Nonetheless, the Constitution copy that I.N.D.I. alliance leaders including Rahul Gandhi have been flashing at everyone roughly measures 20 centimetres in length and nine centimetres in breadth. Its first edition was launched in 2009 and there have been about 16 editions of this book, which have been published so far. The publisher has used Bible paper which is very thin. All the article numbers are in red and the text is in black. EBC publisher Sumeet Malik claims to have sold 5,000 copies in the last three months which is the same number that the publisher sold in 2023. 

",,,"Rahul Gandhi Promises Major Reservation Policy Changes if Congress Wins

","In a recent campaign trail, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi made significant promises concerning reservation policies and the protection of marginalized communities' rights. Addressing supporters in Indore and Khargone, Gandhi emphasized the party's intention to remove the current 50% reservation ceiling in government jobs and increase it to better serve the needs of Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), and economically disadvantaged groups.

Gandhi criticized the ruling BJP, alleging that its leadership aims to undermine reservation rights and alter the Constitution. He warned that the BJP's agenda might jeopardize the protections currently afforded to these groups. Gandhi assured his audience that the Congress party, if elected, would uphold and extend these reservations to ensure fair representation and support for marginalized communities.

The Congress leader also outlined several key promises in the party’s manifesto, including the Mahalaxmi Yojana, which aims to lift poor families above the poverty line, and a comprehensive plan to provide economic assistance to farmers. Gandhi pledged to implement job creation schemes for youth and increase wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).

In addition, Gandhi highlighted his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies, including demonetization and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which he claimed have disproportionately harmed small businesses and farmers. He accused Modi of favoring billionaires while neglecting the needs of ordinary citizens.

Gandhi also emphasized the Congress party's commitment to increasing transparency and participation for marginalized groups by advocating for a caste-based census. This would, he argued, help in better understanding and addressing the needs of these communities.

Criticism and Controversy Surrounding Rahul Gandhi's Campaign Promises

Rahul Gandhi’s recent campaign rhetoric has faced scrutiny and criticism. While he has positioned himself as a defender of the Constitution and reservation rights, there are allegations that his portrayal might be misleading. Gandhi has been seen waving a pocket-sized version of the Constitution, reportedly published by Eastern Book Company, which has been associated with controversial views on reservation policies.

The Constitution edition Gandhi is using was conceived by Supreme Court advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who has expressed opposition to extending reservations beyond the SC/ST categories and has advocated for the introduction of a ""creamy layer"" concept to limit benefits to the most disadvantaged within these groups. Sankaranarayanan's stance includes concerns about the inclusion of more privileged communities within the OBC category and has challenged the extension of reservations to economically weaker sections (EWS).

Critics argue that Gandhi's use of this particular edition of the Constitution might be inconsistent with his campaign promises. While Gandhi has pledged to exceed the current 50% reservation cap, Sankaranarayanan's advocacy suggests a more restrictive approach. Additionally, there have been accusations that Gandhi's claims about the BJP's intentions to alter the Constitution and eliminate reservation rights are exaggerated.

The controversy surrounding the pocket-sized Constitution edition and its association with figures who have criticized current reservation practices has fueled debate about the authenticity and implications of Gandhi’s promises. This debate highlights the ongoing contentious nature of reservation policies and their impact on Indian politics.

As the election approaches, the discussion around these issues continues to be a focal point in the political landscape, reflecting broader concerns about representation, policy, and governance.

https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/national/2024/07/01/par60-ls-ldall-rahul.html,Rahul takes 'not Hindus' jibe at BJP says it indulges in violence hate 24x7,"New Delhi, Jul 1 (PTI) Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi launched a no-holds-barred attack on the BJP in the Lok Sabha on Monday, saying the leaders of the ruling party are not Hindus as they engage in ""violence and hate"" round the clock, drawing massive protests from the treasury benches, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing the Congress leader of calling the entire Hindu community violent.
    Gandhi, however, hit back at Modi, saying he was speaking about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and neither the ruling party nor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) nor Modi represents the entire Hindu society.
    Besides Modi, who intervened twice, at least five cabinet ministers also interjected during Gandhi's speech that lasted for about an hour and 40 minutes, with Home Minister Amit Shah demanding his apology for painting the Hindu community as violent.
    ""It is not just one religion that talks about courage. In fact, all our religions talk about courage,"" Gandhi said in his debut speech as the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha that was watched by his mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from the visitors' gallery.
    Gandhi quoted Prophet Mohammad to highlight that the Quran also talks about fearlessness and said when our hands are raised for ""dua"", the ""abhay mudra"" can also be observed in a way.
    Holding up pictures of Lord Shiva, Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ, he referred to Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism and Jainism to underline the importance of fearlessness. He also cited the attributes of Lord Shiva and teachings of Guru Nanak, Jesus Christ, Buddha and Mahavir to state that all religions and great people of the country have said ""daro mat, darao mat (do not be scared, do not scare others)"".
    ""Shivji says daro mat, darao mat, shows the abhay mudra (the right hand held upright with the palm facing outwards), talks about ahimsa, but those who call themselves Hindus indulge in hatred, violence and untruths round the clock,"" Gandhi said, pointing towards the BJP MPs.
    As the treasury-bench members stood up in protest, Gandhi slammed the BJP, saying, ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus). It is clearly written in Hinduism that one should stand with the truth and not back down from the truth or be scared of it,"" he said.
    Intervening during his speech, Modi said, ""This issue is very serious. Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a serious issue.""
    Gandhi said he is talking about the BJP and the ruling party is not the sole representative of Hinduism.
    ""Ye theka nahi hai BJP ka,"" he said.
    Shah sought the Congress leader's apology to the House and the country for hurting the feelings of crores of people who take pride in identifying themselves as Hindus.
    He said the ruckus created by the opposition cannot drown the fact that the words -- ""those who call themselves Hindus indulge in violence"" -- were used in the House.
    Shah spoke of the Emergency and 1984 anti-Sikhs riots to hit back at Gandhi, saying he has no right to talk about non-violence when the Congress had spread ""ideological terror"" in the country.
    In a swipe at Gandhi for alleging that ministers do not greet him due to the fear of Modi, the prime minister said democracy and the Constitution have taught him to take the leader of opposition seriously.
    Gandhi accused the BJP of launching ""systematic attacks"" on the Constitution and the fundamental idea of India, noting that millions of people have resisted the ideas proposed by the ruling party.
    ""I was attacked on the orders of Prime Minister Modi and the government. There were 20-plus cases (against me), a two-year jail sentence, (my) house was taken away, 55 hours of interrogation by the ED,"" he said.
    As Gandhi held up a picture of Lord Shiva, Speaker Om Birla reminded him that rules do not allow displaying placards in the House.
    The Congress leader also accused the BJP of threatening minorities and spreading hatred and violence against Muslims, Sikhs and Christians.
    He said minorities represent India in all spheres and bring pride to the nation. ""They stand like a rock with the country and are patriots, but you (BJP) attack them,"" he said.
    Referring to the Agnipath scheme for short-term military recruitment, Gandhi said the government regards the Agniveers as ""use-and-throw labourers"" and does not even give them the status of a ""shaheed"" (martyr).
    Defence Minister Rajnath Singh intervened to rebut Gandhi's charge and said an Agniveer who lays down his life in the line of duty gets a compensation of Rs 1 crore.
    ""This House is not for spreading lies. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the House, to the country and to Agniveers,"" Shah said.
    Gandhi claimed that the armed forces know that Agnipath was Modi's brainchild, prompting Singh to accuse the leader of opposition of misleading the House.
    ""If we come to power, we will scrap the Agnipath scheme as it is against jawans, the armed forces and deshbhakts (patriots),"" Gandhi said.
    He also hit out at the Centre over the situation in Manipur, alleging that it has pushed the northeastern state into a civil war.
    The former Congress chief also slammed the government over farmers' issues, saying it did not want to give a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for crops.
    Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan objected to Gandhi's remarks and accused him of ""misleading"" the House. Union ministers Kiren Rijiju and Bhupender Yadav also intervened at different points of Gandhi's speech.
    Later, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, along with Rijiju and BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi, held a press conference to rebut Gandhi's allegations.
    Referring to a row involving medical entrance exam NEET, Gandhi said students do not believe in the exam because they feel that it is for the rich people and there is no place in it for meritorious students.
    Talking about his new role as the leader of opposition, Gandhi said his job is to represent all parties equally with love and affection.
    ""So when Hemant Soren or (Arvind) Kejriwal goes to jail, I should be concerned. When you unleash enforcement agencies on them, we should defend them. When you are a constitutional person, your personal aspirations should take a back seat,"" he said.
    In his concluding remarks, Gandhi asked the ruling party not to spread fear or hatred in the minds of people.
    ""Do not think of the opposition as your enemies. We are ready to discuss any issue that you bring before us. I congratulate you for winning 240 seats,"" he said",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/as-rahul-gandhi-equates-hinduism-ahimsa-in-lok-sabha-hindus-must-not-fall-for-another-gandhi/,"As Rahul Gandhi equates Hinduism with Ahimsa, time to remember why Hindus must not fall for ‘another Gandhi’","Ahimsa, essentially, is doing everything to stop Himsa. Ahimsa is not the absence of Himsa, but the use of Sam, Dam, Danda, Bhed to achieve peace. We could see Rahul Gandhi's speech today in the parliament as just another Hinduphobic rant. Or we could see it for what it was - an attempt to keep the Hindu community ashamed and guilty. India has suffered the consequences of the apotheosis of one Gandhi - we certainly cannot afford another blunder.

Calling it as one sees it is a burden that some bear. While it is often branded a virtue, for me, it has been a physiological reflex, often, much to my detriment. It is almost as if I am simply incapable of shutting up, even when shutting up would certainly have its rewards. One subject that I have, yet again, refused to shut up about and invited the anger of many fellow Hindus, is the merciless defanging of the Hindu community by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

I genuinely and truly believe that the bane of the Hindu community was internalising the lessons of misplaced Ahimsa, predominantly spoon-fed by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi – a man who was ‘christened’, quite literally, as a messiah. The internalised guilt inflicted on the community even when it wanted to defend itself crippled us for generations and to date, we pay the price for trading our right to survival for brotherhood – a sentiment that is delicately nursed by carefully inculcated delusions.

I have, of course, been conferred with several not-so-flattering titles for the views I hold on the issue. In fact, I have often had arguments with my colleague Rahul Roushan on the subject as well. While I believe MK Gandhi was the Hindu community’s undoing, Rahul seems to be far more forgiving. He has repeatedly asserted that he forgives MK Gandhi for his shenanigans because he was a practicing Hindu and was not Hinduphobic – like Nehru, for example. While I insist that MK Gandhi and the ideals he professed must be torn down and dethroned, Rahul believes that Hindus gain nothing by demonising Gandhi and is willing to let him have the throne along with others who perhaps deserve the pedestal.

I had just about moved on from MK Gandhi and started to shift my focus to Dr BR Ambedkar when I heard another ‘Gandhi’ trying the same tricks that MK Gandhi employed, only in a far more sinister manner.

Rahul Gandhi in the parliament said, “Modi ji said once that India has never attacked any other country. There is a reason for that. Because this country is a country of Ahimsa (non-violence), this country is not a country of fear. So all our great personalities spoke about Ahimsa, spoke about removing fear… daro mat, darao mat… and on the other hand, Shiv ji says daro mat, darao mat, shows the Abhay Mudra, talks about Ahimsa and buries his Trishul on the ground. And the people who call themselves Hindus talk about violence, hate and lies 24 hours. You are not a Hindu. In Hinduism, it is clearly mentioned that one should stand with the truth…”. After this, Rahul Gandhi randomly held out his hand to show the Abhay Mudra (essentially, claiming that it was the Congress hand symbol).

Now, we know this rant by Rahul Gandhi is insidious. We know it is sinister. But my reaction to Rahul Gandhi’s rant this time was far more circumspect. I found myself not dismissing him as a blithering fool, but instead, trying to put his speech in context – historical and contemporary.

For those who support PM Modi politically, their immediate reaction would be to say that Rahul Gandhi insulted the entire Hindu community by claiming that Hindus only talk about violence and hate. Of course, this is the simplest interpretation of what he said. I, however, believe there is more to it.

There are two specific components to what Rahul Gandhi said in the parliament. First, Hinduism’s core tenet is that of non-violence. The other is that Modi does not represent all Hindus – this he said after PM Modi made a rare intervention saying that Rahul Gandhi’s characterisation of all Hindus as a people who espouse violence is a serious matter.

Both these components were meant to specifically cater to disgruntled Modi supporters and the young voter – who is fed the “Sabarmati ke sant” delusion as a matter of state policy. As for the second component, I believe it is meant to specifically cater to the ‘disgruntled Hindu voter’ – a segment that has started to look beyond PM Modi for a resolution to Hindu issues. This disgruntled voter believes that the political support base has started hyphenating PM Modi and Hindu issues, often sacrificing the latter for the interest of the former. For both these segments, it is essential to see through the sinister, British-esque designs of Rahul Gandhi.

Ahimsa – a central tenet of Hinduism?
One of the first instances when Hindus were defanged by the British was with the passage of The Indian Arms Act 1878. Right after the revolt of 1857, the British, petrified of another armed resistance to their occupations, passed a law that barred Indians from carrying firearms without a license. The British understood that their best chance to continue their occupation of Bharat was through the de-arming and de-fanging of Hindus.

The de-arming and neutering of Hindus to ensure minimum resistance to their own subjugation became a template – followed not only by the British and MK Gandhi but continued to this day by the party created by the British – the Congress party.

Rahul Gandhi, quite confidently, spoke about Ahimsa being the central tenet of Sanatan Dharma – as if those who pick up weapons to defend themselves and/or the community are committing a cardinal sin. One can’t possibly blame him for his narrow view of Sanatan Dharma, given his Christian mother must have imparted the hollow punchlines that come with religious moral science lectures in Catholic schools as the gospel truth – at least theoretically, which is never followed by the faithful but prove as a great tool for religious brainwashing by inculcating a false sense of moral superiority. Sanatan Dharma has an illustrious history and the Kshatra tradition which revolves around the destruction of evil and is far from the neutered, comatose version of Hinduism that Congress wants to peddle for their own political gains.


One of the primary root words of Kshatra is ‘himsayam’ which relates to the Kshatra’s duty to destroy evil. The etymological explanation of the word Kshatra is, in itself, “one who protects from harm and injury”, the fundamental quality of the Kshatra being to protect Dharma and therefore, the Kshatra-guna itself is related to protection – by force – if necessary.

The pacifists, who follow the path shown by MK Gandhi, often feel squeamish because they believe the Kshatra-guna relates to the promotion of violence, however, that is, again, only a result of the historical brainwashing – a political project to knock Hindus down and keep them there so the pliable community can accept their own subjugation without putting up a fight.

It is, therefore, said that “without the element of protection, Matsya-Nyaya (big fish eat little fish) would prevail”. It is the eternal Sanatan wisdom that says that if there has to be order, there has to be punishment and only if there is punishment, will order emerge. Kamandakiya–Nitisara, in fact, opens with the praise of the King who holds the sceptre to mete out punishment to maintain order.

In the book Ksattra, the authors write, “Among the Vedas, the Rig-veda has been associated with Brahmanas, Yajur-veda with Kṣattriyas, and Sama-veda with Vaisyas. The Yajur-veda has been hailed as an action-oriented, ritual-intensive Veda; while Rig-veda is more aligned to prayer, Sama-veda is aligned to worship, and Atharva-veda forms a bridge between the physical and the spiritual.

Yajur-veda is a symbol of kṣättra, of the protection of the good, and of destruction of enemies. The upa-veda associated with Yajur-veda is Artha-Veda (or Dhanur-veda). While explaining a mantra, the commentator Mahīdāsa says, “Dhanur-veda (archery) is the science of war.”

Through the Dhanur-veda we see the entire system of war. Yajñas like Rajasuya, Sautramani, Vajapeya, and Aśva- medha that are described in the Yajur-veda are famous as kṣāttra-yajñas. The Vajapeya-Yaga is for preparing various units of the army in order to reclaim lost land. The Sautrāmani-Yaga is for bringing allies together. The Rajasuya-yaga is conducted when an emperor is born or created. The Aśva-medha is for expanding the kingdom and establishing sovereign status over a large portion of land. We see unbridled kṣättra in all these yajñas.

There are elements of kṣättra even in the traditional practices related to worship and invoking the Supreme. The unfortunate situation today is that a worship of cowardice has entered military science. We have infused our military with a narrow, ritualistic mindset, thus sapping bravery and energy. However, our Vedic rşis brought an element of kṣättra even in worship and ritual”.

It is, therefore, evident that Sanatan has a strong, illustrious tradition of Kshatra – where force and punishment are used to restore Dharma, protect the weak, and defend the ideals we hold dear. Nowhere in the Yajur-Veda, or any Veda, is Ahimsa in its bastardized, Gandhi version mentioned – it is only an illusion, a grand lie, sold to Hindus to ensure they remain guilty, neutered, and defenceless.

What betrays the Janeudhari version of himself which Rahul Gandhi projects, is his absolute infantile interpretation of Shiva. To allude that Mahadev buried his Trishul because he believed in Gandhi’s Ahimsa is not just infantile but asinine. Mahadev, is quite literally, the God of Destruction and anyone who is a practicing Hindu would certainly not propagate that he destroys with Ahimsa. The Shivlinga itself is a manifestation of Raudra. His Avatars, like Kaal Bhairav, represent the annihilation of time and preservation of the universe – a symbol of fearlessness, the guardian of Temples, the destroyer of enemies and evil spirits. Of course, there is spiritual symbolism of the Trishul which represents the Nadis, levels of consciousness, and more, however, Rahul Gandhi’s reductionist interpretation of Shiva and his Trishul to talk about some binary of Gandhi-esque pacifism is so outlandish that one has to wonder how someone so oblivious of Sanatan Dharma can even have the confidence to talk about the tenets of the faith. In his supreme confidence, which is, unfortunately, the hallmark of the unlettered, Rahul Gandhi wanted to present Sanatan Dharma as some sort of a hippy cult where its participants are high on some form of hallucinogens, lying around in their comatose stupor, talking about universal peace. In reality, Sanatan has a long tradition of Akharas where community defence was one of the fulcrums of collective survival.

Yes, Sanatan Dharma guides every shade and stage of existence. From prosperity to happiness, satisfaction, love, peace – inner and community, punya, karma, moksha, and more – however – it does not look down upon self and community defence, it does not glamourise pacifism and cowardice – in fact – it draws lessons from wars fought for the preservation of Dharma and honour.

Non-violence: An age-old political project to keep Hindus neutered and subjugated
I believe the very existence of the Hindu community hinges on one simple question – Do we wish to emulate MK Gandhi or Gopal Patha – in the face of aggression and violence?

In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. 

On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionizing Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. 

What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off, and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against. 

During the Direct Action Day, on the 17th of August after 2 days of Hindus being massacred, Gopal Chandra Mukhopadhyay rose like a phoenix. Gopal Patha (Patha means ‘lamb’. He was called so because he ran a mutton shop) had already founded the Bharat Jatiya Bahini, an organization of young men to help fellow citizens during a natural calamity. On the 17th, Gopal Patha turned from a philanthropist to a warrior, ready to defend his people. Throughout the night, Gopal Patha, along with his young men from the Bharat Jayati Bahini worked on a plan on how they could defend Hindus from the Muslim barbarians. The Marwaris offered finances, others spent the night making weapons for them. 

Muslim League chief minister of Bengal, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and the Muslim League goons had decided on the 17th that they were going to take two more days to complete the annihilation of Hindus. But they had not taken into consideration their greatest roadblock. Gopal Patha. 

From the 18th to the 20th, Gopal Patha and his men put up a brave fight, paying the Muslim League goons back in equal measure, if not more. Historian Sandip Bandopadhyay wrote, “They faced resistance everywhere. Hindu youths counter-attacked with such ferocity that the Muslim League men had to flee. Many were killed. Emboldened by their success in taking on and defeating their Islamist attackers, Hindu youths took the fight to Muslim-majority areas and started killing Islamist men. They did not, however, touch Muslim women and children or the aged and the infirm”.

During the Noakhali riots, countless Hindus were raped and murdered. The converted Hindus were made to write declarations that they had accepted Islam out of their free will and Hindus in the 2000 square mile area were made to pay the Jaziya. When MK Gandhi visited Naokhali, he was rebuked by the Muslim League and after that, he travelled to Bihar to stop the retaliatory violence by the Hindus. There, he is famed to have said that Hindus must leave Noakhali or die – this, because the Muslim League had asked him to quell the violence, the same Muslim League that was raping Hindu women, beheading Hindu women, and waging a war against Kaffirs. 

MK Gandhi famously asked Gopal Patha to lay his weapons down and surrender. Gopal Patha refused. He refused to give into Gandhi’s pacifism to appease the murderous Jihadis. He refused to give into the delusion that surrendering, being cowardly, and dying with a smile on his face was a virtue. Gopal Patha upheld the tenets of Sanatan Dharma – he preserved Dharma. He protected Dharma. He protected Hindus. He did not give up.

In fact, while MK Gandhi wanted Gopal Patha to lay down his weapons, in the same year in a prayer meeting, he advised the women in East Bengal to commit suicide by poison or some other means to avoid dishonour. He told the women to suffocate themselves or to bite their tongues to end their lives.

In 1921, while the Malabar Muslims were slaughtering Hindus, raping women and forcefully converting Hindus, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi insisted that they had committed a sin against the “Khilafat movement” and not the Hindus. In fact, he went ahead and insisted that Hindus must remain “non-violent” in the face of “extreme provocation”.

While Hindus and Sikhs were being massacred and raped in Pakistan right after the partition, MK Gandhi said, “Hindus and Sikhs should become brave and show that even if all the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan were to be killed there would be no retaliation in India. I do not want to live to see our people copy Pakistan. If I am to live I shall ask every Hindu and every Sikh not to touch a single Muslim. It is cowardice to kill Muslims and we must become brave and not cowards”.

On April 6, 1947, Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi said– “If Muslims want to kill us (Hindus), we must face death bravely. Hindus should not harbour anger in their hearts against Muslims even if the latter wanted to destroy them. If they established their rule after killing Hindus we would be ushering in a new world by sacrificing our (Hindu) lives”. 

There was, indeed, a running theme in what Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi told Hindus. He repeatedly told Hindus that their faith taught them to surrender to evil, murderous mobs who were raping, beheading, murdering, and dishonouring them. He repeatedly told Hindus that his pacifism was a manifestation of the very essence of Sanatan Dharma and if Hindus so much as dared to defend themselves, they would be going against the tenets of their faith.

MK Gandhi told Hindus that cowardice was in fact bravery and bravery was betrayal. He truly and genuinely wanted Hindus to believe that by being cowardly and surrendering to evil unquestioningly, Hindus would be doing the greatest service to this land with Hindu consciousness because that is what Hinduism stood for.

This glorification of cowardice as a virtue, only for Hindus, was diligently furthered as a political project. It was, and still is, accepted wisdom that as long as Hindus are kept under the spell of Ahimsa, the community would give up their bargaining power with the state. For the ultimate retention of political power, it is no secret that the most violent, the most demanding, and the most petulant community has to be kept in good humour. When they get offended, and go on a murderous rampage after Hindus respond with Rangeela Rasool to books insulting Hindus, they need to be kept in good humour by the passage of a special law. When they want to establish a Caliphate in Turkey, they need to be pacified with unquestioning surrender by the Hindu community, willing to be beheaded with a smile on their face.

Rahul Gandhi today did exactly what the political class has done for centuries – twist Sanatan Dharma to convince Hindus that their cowardice is considered a virtue and if they are TRUE Hindus, they would surrender, give in – and die with a smile on their face. It is this political project that leads to the demonisation of Hindutva, the vilification of Raudra Hanuman, the angst at Bhagwan Ram with a bow and arrow, the screaming, screeching uproar at the Ayodhya movement, the aversion to the Ram Temple, the anger at the demystification of history and the unadulterated hate against Hindu organizations – all of it remind Hindus that they are a warrior race, not a herd of sheep who should be led to their slaughter.

Ahimsa, essentially, is doing everything to stop Himsa. Ahimsa is not the absence of Himsa, but the use of Sam, Dam, Danda, and Bhed to achieve peace.

We could see Rahul Gandhi’s speech today in the parliament as just another Hinduphobic rant. Or we could see it for what it was – an attempt to keep the Hindu community ashamed and guilty. India has suffered the consequences of the apotheosis of one Gandhi – we certainly cannot afford another blunder.



",,,"New Delhi, August 10 (PTI) - Political Debate Erupts in Lok Sabha as Rahul Gandhi Criticizes BJP's Approach
","In a heated session of the Lok Sabha on Monday, Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi made significant remarks targeting the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing it of perpetuating violence and intolerance. Gandhi's comments, which sparked a flurry of reactions from across the political spectrum, centered on his critique of the BJP’s policies and its portrayal of Hindu values.

Gandhi's speech, which lasted over an hour and a half, was marked by his defense of the principle of non-violence as espoused in various religions. He emphasized that his critique was directed at the BJP and not the Hindu community as a whole. Gandhi used religious references, including quotes from Prophet Mohammad and symbols from Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, and Christianity, to argue that true adherence to these faiths involves courage and non-violence.

The Prime Minister and several cabinet ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah, strongly rebutted Gandhi's allegations. Modi accused Gandhi of unfairly painting the Hindu community with a broad brush of violence. In response, Gandhi reiterated that his comments were aimed specifically at the BJP’s actions and not at the entire Hindu population. He emphasized that the BJP does not represent the entirety of Hinduism or its values.

The debate intensified when Shah demanded an apology from Gandhi for allegedly offending Hindus. Shah and other ministers criticized Gandhi’s statements, pointing out that similar accusations had been levied against the Congress party in the past. They also brought up historical issues, such as the Emergency and anti-Sikh riots of 1984, to counter Gandhi’s arguments.

During the discussion, Gandhi also touched upon several other issues, including the Agnipath scheme and the situation in Manipur. He criticized the government’s handling of these matters, accusing it of neglecting the needs of soldiers and farmers and mishandling regional conflicts.

In a parallel development, the Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and other BJP leaders held a press conference to address the allegations made by Gandhi. They argued that Gandhi’s remarks were misleading and aimed at creating division rather than fostering constructive debate.

Despite the high tensions, Gandhi concluded his speech by extending an olive branch to the ruling party. He called for a cooperative approach to addressing national issues and urged against spreading fear or hatred. His comments reflect his broader aim of representing diverse viewpoints in his role as the leader of the opposition, while navigating the complex political landscape of contemporary India.

He said that the Opposition has remained calm, following god's 'abhay mudra', even after so many attacks by the government. Rahul Gandhi said all religions talk about courage and cited Islam, Sikhism to underline one should be fearless. He attacked BJP in Lok Sabha, saying Hinduism is not about spreading fear, hatred and falsehoods. Objecting to the claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""calling entire Hindu society violent is a serious issue."" Union home minister Amit Shah and other NDA MPs also protested against Rahul's claim and said that he must apologise for his statement on Hinduism. However, Rahul reverted to the objection saying ""BJP, Modi are not entire Hindu society."" ""If you look at Lord Shiva's image you would know that Hindus can never spread fear, hatred but BJP spreads fear, hatred 24X7,"" he further said. 'I was attacked by PM Modi' Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister, Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi further said that he was attacked on the orders of government and PM Modi. ""I was attacked on orders of PM Modi; there were 20 plus cases, house was taken away, 55 hours of interrogation by ED,"" he said.",https://www.opindia.com/2024/07/all-india-sufi-sajjadanashin-council-rubbishes-rahul-gandhi-abhaya-mudra-in-islam-remark/,"‘There is no mention of idol worship in Islam, nor is there any kind of mudra’: Muslim cleric rubbishes Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Abhaya Mudra’ in Islam remark","""While speaking in the Parliament today, Rahul Gandhi has said 'Abhaya Mudra' is also there in Islam. There is no mention of idol worship in Islam, nor is there any kind of mudra. I refute it, there is no mention of 'Abhaya Mudra' in Islam and I believe that Rahul Gandhi should correct his statement,"" Chishty said.

Syed Naseruddin Chishty, Chairman of All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, refuted controversial remarks made by Rahul Gandhi in the parliament on Monday. The Gandhi scion had tried to link ‘Abhaya Mudra’ seen in the images of Hindu gods and goddesses to the election symbol of his party and to all other religions, including Islam, which forbids idol-worshipping.

“Islam also says darna nahin hai (don’t be scared). When prayers are done in Islam, abhay-mudra is seen in both hands,” Gandhi said.

However, Gandhi’s comments did not sit well with Syed Naseruddin Chisty, who denounced his claims saying, “While speaking in the Parliament today, Rahul Gandhi has said ‘Abhaya Mudra’ is also there in Islam. There is no mention of idol worship in Islam, nor is there any kind of mudra. I refute it, there is no mention of ‘Abhaya Mudra’ in Islam and I believe that Rahul Gandhi should correct his statement.”


Rahul’s perverse attempt to link all religions to the Congress party’s symbol and forge a faux unity among different sections of society comes after months of divisive political campaigning, which included promising a caste census and redistribution of wealth based on population to exploit the existing faultlines, especially among the Hindu society where caste still holds dominance.

Gandhi’s disdain for the Hindu community was evident earlier today when he made a controversial remark that spurred a rare intervention from PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, both of whom corrected the Gandhi scion for his sweeping proclamation that those who call themselves Hindus indulge in violence all the time.

During his speech, Rahul Gandhi, said, “All our great men have spoken about non-violence and eliminating fear… But those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth…”

PM Modi raised serious objection to Rahul Gandhi’s comments saying, “Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.”

Following a heated exchange between the Opposition and the ruling NDA’s MPs, Union Minister Amit Shah called for an apology from Rahul Gandhi.

Union Minister Amit Shah criticised Rahul Gandhi’s comment, insisting on an apology.

“The Leader of the Opposition has clearly stated that those who identify as Hindu speak of and commit violence. He is unaware that millions proudly call themselves Hindu. Associating violence with any religion is wrong. He should apologize,” he stated.

",,,Parliamentary Debate on Interfaith Symbols and Political Statements Sparks Controversy,"In a heated session of the Lok Sabha on Monday, Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi made a provocative comparison involving Hindu religious symbols during his speech. Gandhi drew parallels between the Hindu god Shiva's 'abhaya mudra,' or gesture of fearlessness, and the ethos of the Opposition, suggesting that despite numerous attacks by the government, the Opposition has maintained its composure in a manner akin to the divine symbol. He further extended this comparison to argue that all religions advocate for courage, referencing Islam and Sikhism to underscore his point that fearlessness should be a universal value.

Gandhi's comments were met with strong reactions from the ruling party. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah criticized Gandhi's remarks as a misrepresentation of Hinduism. Modi specifically objected to the implication that the entire Hindu community is associated with violence, which he deemed a serious and unacceptable accusation. Amit Shah and other members of the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) called for Gandhi to issue an apology, asserting that his statement unfairly generalized the Hindu population and could incite discord.

In response, Rahul Gandhi defended his position by clarifying that his critique was aimed at the actions of the BJP and its leadership, not at the broader Hindu community. He argued that his reference to Lord Shiva was intended to illustrate a contrast between the values he attributes to the BJP and those he believes are reflected in Hindu philosophy, rather than to target the entire religion.

Further intensifying the debate, Syed Naseruddin Chishty, Chairman of the All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, also weighed in. Chishty challenged Gandhi's claims regarding the 'abhaya mudra,' asserting that such gestures are not part of Islamic tradition and criticized Gandhi's attempt to link his party's symbol with various religious teachings. Chishty suggested that Gandhi's comments could be seen as an attempt to politically manipulate religious symbols to foster divisiveness.

The exchange highlights ongoing tensions in Indian politics, particularly around issues of religious identity and political rhetoric. As the controversy continues to unfold, it underscores the challenges of navigating interfaith dialogue and political discourse in a diverse and complex society.

Mr. Gandhi, however, retorted that he was speaking about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) or Mr. Modi are not the entire Hindu society, he added.

The Congress leader held up a picture of Lord Shiva and said his message is about fearlessness and non-violence. He also cited the teachings of other religions to make a similar point.

""All religions and all our great men talk about non-violence and fearlessness, but those who call themselves Hindus only talk about violence, hatred and falsehood.... Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus),"" he said.

Mr. Gandhi's dig at the BJP had the members of the treasury benches on their feet.

Home Minister Amit Shah sought the Congress leader's apology to the House and the country for hurting the feelings of crores of people who take pride in identifying themselves as Hindus.

Mr. Shah spoke of the Emergency and 1984 anti-Sikhs riots to hit back at Mr. Gandhi, saying he had no right to talk about non-violence when the Congress had spread ""terror"" in the country.

Mr. Gandhi further emphasised that all religions talk about courage, citing Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism to underline the importance of fearlessness.

He accused the BJP of launching systematic attacks on the Constitution and the fundamental idea of India, noting that millions of people have resisted the ideas proposed by the ruling party.

""I was attacked on the orders of Prime Minister Modi. There were 20-plus cases (against me), (my) house was taken away, 55 hours of interrogation by the ED,"" Mr. Gandhi said.

Despite these challenges, he said he feels proud of the collective effort to protect the Constitution.

On 1st July, Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi provoked fury in the Lok Sabha with his controversial remarks, forcing a rare intervention from Prime Minister Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Speaking in parliament, Gandhi claimed that individuals who identified as Hindus only talked about violence, bigotry, and lies, prompting Prime Minister Modi to interrupt.

“Those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth,” Gandhi was quoted as saying. To this, PM Modi raised serious objection to Rahul Gandhi’s comments saying, “Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.”


Gandhi also showed Lord Shiva’s picture in the House after he attacked BJP saying Hinduism is not about spreading fear, hatred, and falsehoods. Further, he displayed placards featuring images of Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ. He was also carrying a placard featuring a quote from the Quran. “All our great men have spoken about non-violence and ending fear. But, those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, and untruth,” Gandhi said, adding, “Aap Hindu ho hi nahi.” (You are not a Hindu).


India Today
Union Minister Amit Shah meanwhile criticized Rahul Gandhi’s comment, insisting on an apology. “The Leader of the Opposition has clearly stated that those who identify as Hindu speak of and commit violence. He is unaware that millions proudly call themselves Hindu. Associating violence with any religion is wrong. He should apologize,” he stated.

Gandhi is known for making anti-India and anti-Hindu statements. However, this time he attempted to enrage the entire Hindu community by calling them violent. Gandhi seems to have selectively forgotten that several incidents have appeared in the recent past that have been committed by the Muslim community. It is the Islamists who deliberately target the Hindu community and harass them for belonging to a particular religion. Here are some of the instances reported from last week where Hindus have been deliberately targeted by the Islamists.

Muslim students assault 4 Hindus for celebrating T20 World Cup win in Nanded, Maharashtra

Following the attack, they fled the scene.


Madrasa teacher, Abdul Rahman, earns triple life sentence for sexually assaulting minor girl student in Kerala
A fast-track court in Kerala’s Tirur convicted a Madrasa teacher, Abdur Rahiman (51), for sexually assaulting a minor girl who was under the age of seven at the time of the crime. Following the conviction, the court sentenced him to triple life imprisonment till the end of his life, 15 years imprisonment in various departments. The court also imposed a fine on the convicted Madrasa teacher and asked him to pay Rs 1.5 lakh. He will have to undergo an additional two years in prison, in case he fails to pay the fine. According to local media reports, it is enough to suffer the punishment together.


The convicted Madrassa teacher, Abdur Rahiman (51) was sentenced in Cheruparambi in southern Kuttur. The Tirur Police had registered a case against Abdur Rahiman on charges of sexually assaulting a student in a classroom in the Tirur area in April and May 2016. 


Sharia in West Bengal?
On 30th June, a video shared by CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim went viral over the internet in which a local Bahubali leader could be seen assaulting a married woman and a man. The duo could be seen lying helplessly on the road in the name of ‘summary Justice’. Sharing the video of the assault, CPI(M) leader and Former Rajya Sabha MP Salim alleged that the main accused seen in the video was a local TMC goon who goes by the nickname ‘JCB’. According to him, the local goon runs a Kangaroo court where he allegedly serves summary trial and punishment like the Taliban.

As the video was shared by the BJP leaders or supporters, the West Bengal police ruled by the I.N.D.I.Alliance associate TMC sent notices to the formers asking them to take the posts down. Several journalists BJP leaders and also advocates were served notices. Taking to X, Bhandari informed about the same and wrote, “Action against criminals: No. Action against journalists reporting the crime: Yes. Welcome to West Bengal!”


Supreme Court lawyer Shashank Shekhar Jha questioned if the West Bengal police has no shame left that they are asking X to delete his post wherein he talked about the incident in question. “What Bengal thinks today, India will think tomorrow. Bengal is thinking Sharia today,” Jha’s post stated.

X user Rishi Bagree said that a case against him for quoting a video of the Chopra incident shared by a CPIM leader. He called the Bengal Police’s action as “real dictatorship”.

“West Bengal Police filed a case against me for quoting a video of Md Salim, CPIM leader. Instead of taking action against the culprit they are busy shooting the messengers. This is how real dictatorship looks like,” Bagree posted.


It is important to note that the Congress party has always used Muslims and favored them as they assisted them in the elections by becoming a strong vote bank. This was evident in the recently happened Lok Sabha elections where Muslims in various places issued fatwas to vote in favor of INC.

Rahul Gandhi also has always extended support to Muslims and Islamists calling them secular. Last year in Washington he had made a statement calling the Muslim League, an off-shoot of Jinnah’s party as ‘completely secular’.

Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), which claims to have been born after Indian Independence in 1948, is an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML). The All India Muslim League was succeeded by the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Indian Union Muslim League in India. On its website, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims that its motto is secularism and communal harmony but has often openly indulged in carrying out those objectives which are contrary to its own motto. The Indian Union Muslim League has been notoriously known for flaring up communal incidents. The party was found involved in the planning as well as the execution of the brutal Marad massacre in Kerala in 2003 as per the report of Justice Thomas P Joseph Commission which was set up to investigate the incident.

Interestingly, Rahul Gandhi had called the Muslim League ‘secular’ in response to a question that said he criticized the BJP for being a “Hindu party” and divisive. Rahul is said to have lambasted the Centre on Monday for a ‘full-scale assault on the notion of India and the Constitution, as well as on those who opposed the attack on the Constitution.’ The remarks have however been condemned by BJP leaders, demanding an apology from Gandhi.

",,,"Parliamentary Exchange on Religion and Politics Sparks Heated Debate

","On July 1, a provocative speech by Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha led to intense debate and significant backlash from the ruling party. Gandhi criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging that those identifying as Hindus are perpetuating ""violence and hate"" continuously. His remarks, aimed specifically at the BJP and its leadership rather than the Hindu community as a whole, sparked a strong reaction from members of the treasury benches, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Gandhi, holding up an image of Lord Shiva, argued that his intention was to highlight the contrast between the values of fearlessness and non-violence embodied by Hinduism and the perceived actions of the BJP. He also referenced teachings from various religions to emphasize his point about universal courage and fearlessness. However, his remarks were interpreted by many as a sweeping condemnation of Hinduism, leading to demands for an apology from the ruling party.

Prime Minister Modi expressed serious concerns about Gandhi's comments, describing the generalization of the Hindu community as violent as a grave issue. Home Minister Amit Shah joined the criticism, accusing Gandhi of misrepresenting Hinduism and calling for a formal apology to address the hurt caused to millions who identify as Hindus.

In response, Gandhi clarified that his comments were directed at the BJP and its practices rather than Hinduism as a religion. He accused the BJP of undermining the Constitution and stated that he had faced personal attacks, including legal and administrative actions, in retaliation for his political stance.

The controversy also saw reactions beyond Parliament. Critics from various political and social groups weighed in on the statements and the broader implications for interfaith dialogue and political discourse. The exchange highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing sensitive issues of religion and politics in India, where public statements can quickly become points of contention across the political spectrum.

Angered by the performance of Muslim men in a cricket tournament, Hindu locals of a Gujarat village on June 22 beat a Muslim spectator at a match to death, The Quint has reported.

Twenty-three year-old Salman Vohra was a resident of Polson compound in Gujarat’s Anand and worked in the garment business. A cricket fan, Vohra had gone to watch a match at Chikhodra, his uncle Noman Anwar Vohra told the news outlet. There had been tension in the atmosphere over pro-Hindutva residents’ opposition to Muslim players doing well in the tournament.

“When they were playing, a section of the crowd began shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’,” an activist, Aasim Khedawala, told Quint.

The match drew a crowd of 5,000 people but Muslims were not more than 500 in number. A drunk man picked a fight with Vohra over where his motorcycle was parked.

“The one who was drunk mistook another Muslim man, Suhail to be Salman [Vohra] and began attacking him. In order to save Suhail from these men, Salman jumped in and the mob surrounded him,” the report said.

A crowd reportedly gathered and chanted in favour of hitting Vohra. His uncle noted that the attackers almost bit his ear off, that a knife wound had damaged his kidney and beaten on his lower waist and neck. He was taken to a hospital for treatment and then referred to a bigger one. He succumbed to his injuries at the second hospital.

Vohra’s wife Mashira is a few weeks pregnant.

Two other Muslim men were also grievously injured, one had to receive 17 stitches and the other, around seven. Maktoob Media has noted that this is the sixth such lynching since June 4.

The family filed a first information report at 4 am on June 23 at the Anand Rural police station.

Nine people have been arrested. They are Mehul Dinesh Parmar, Kiran Mafat Parmar, Mahendra Ramesh Vaghela, Ketan Mahendra Patel, Akshay Narsinh Parmar,Ratilala Raising Parmar, Vijay Mangal Parmar, Mukesh Rajesh Parmar, Rakesh Babu Parmar, Vijay Chhagan Parmarand Ketan Bharat Parmar.

People who spoke to The Quint said that two of the main men who beat him up have not been arrested yet. Hyderabad member of parliament Asaduddin Owaisi has posted on X the claim that “[s]ome members of the Kshatriya community are reportedly pressurising the police to remove the name of Shakti Singh from the list of accused.

","The altercation regarding the parking of a bike soon turned violent in which a 23-year-old youth lost his life. Following the incident, Police arrested 9 accused, presented them before the court, and got their remand.

A few days ago a cricket tournament was organised in the Chikhodara area of Anand, Gujarat. While the cricket match was going on in the late evening, an altercation broke out between some people over a parking dispute. The altercation regarding the parking of a bike soon turned violent in which a 23-year-old youth lost his life. Following the incident, Police arrested 9 accused, presented them before the court, and got their remand. However, left-wing portals including The Wire, Quint, Maktoob Media, and The Kashmiriyat gave a communal angle to the whole incident and tried to spread animosity between the two communities. 

Notably, the incident took place on 22nd June 2024. The deceased was identified as Salman Whora. He arrived there to watch the cricket tournament which was being played at Chikhodara, late in the evening. 


Meanwhile, a person named Imroz Abdul Rahim got into an argument with the accused. Soon, the argument over the issue of bike parking turned into a fistfight. During this time, the deceased Salman Muhammad Hanif Whora intervened to defend Imroz. It is alleged that the accused assaulted them with a bat and other sharp weapons. Afterward, both of them were shifted to a hospital for treatment. However, 23-year-old Salman died during treatment.

Based on Imroz’s complaint, the police have so far arrested 9 people – 7 accused were initially arrested and 2 were later – and 2 accused are said to be absconding. The Police are carrying out a search operation to nab them. After their demand was over, the police produced them again before the court.

In this matter, the Police have registered a case against the accused under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 302, 324, 323, 504, and 506(2) of the IPC and Section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act.

Leftist media gives the parking dispute incident a communal colour
However, in its reportage, leftist media including The Wire, The Quint, Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat, and some other portals tried to paint this whole incident in a communal colour. They alleged that Hindutva supporters were angry at Muslims who were playing well and they killed a Muslim man. They further alleged that Hindus gathered in the crowd and were chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans during the match. They went further to allege that at the time of the incident, Hindus in the crowd were inciting the killers. 

Media claim completely wrong: DySP Panchal
OpIndia tried to find out the truth about the entire incident and first contacted Anand district DySP Jayesh Panchal. During the conversation, OpIndia asked the Deputy SP about the claims being made in the media reports. 

Responding to the query, he said, “The kind of communal angle that the media is talking about is completely wrong. Police are continuously investigating after the incident. We have interrogated the arrested accused, they also did not say any such thing, the statements of the people present in the field during the incident have also been taken. Even the eyewitnesses have not recorded anything like this in the statement.”

During the conversation, he further stated, “Not only this, the person who is the complainant in the incident has also not mentioned any such incident in his complaint.” 


When OpIndia asked him about the slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” and the claims about the Hindu crowd during the cricket match, he outrightly denied it. 

He said, “In the investigation so far, no incident of this kind has come to our notice, either in the statement of the complainant, the witness, or the accused. ” 

He noted that there was a clash over a motorcycle and added that the claims made in the media were false.


The incident does not have a communal angle: a local Muslim leader
After the conversation with the DySP, OpIndia spoke to Ismailbhai, a local Muslim leader. He told OpIndia, “The slogans raised during the match have nothing to do with the murder. There is no communal angle in this whole incident. What has happened is very wrong. The deceased was recently married. The assailants hit him in the kidney and seriously injured him. All we want is that those who are responsible should be severely punished.” 

When OpIndia asked him about the religious angle in the murder, he said, “Look, the incident is very bad and serious. But let’s not be wrong, there is no communal element in this. The angle does not appear.”

After speaking to Ismailbhai, OpIndia spoke to another local. On condition of anonymity, he said, “People from both parties were present on the ground at the time of the incident. Cricket matches are always held here, but nothing like this has ever happened. People who are saying this is a matter between two communities are totally wrong. Everyone lives in harmony here. The whole tussle was about the parking of a bike. The police have arrested the accused and the matter is now in court. Hope the court will do justice and punish the accused severely.”

",,,Cricket Match Altercation in Gujarat Results in Fatality and Arrests,"On June 22, a violent altercation during a cricket match in Chikhodra, Gujarat, led to the death of 23-year-old Salman Vohra. Vohra, who had gone to watch the match, was fatally injured after an argument over motorcycle parking escalated into violence. The Gujarat Police have arrested nine individuals in connection with the incident, presenting them before the court for remand.

According to reports, tensions arose between local spectators during the cricket match, which drew a large crowd. An argument over the parking of a motorcycle turned physical when Vohra intervened to defend another individual, Imroz Abdul Rahim. The confrontation reportedly escalated, leading to Vohra being attacked with blunt and sharp weapons. Despite being rushed to a hospital, Vohra succumbed to his injuries.

The police have charged the accused under several sections of the Indian Penal Code, including those related to murder and causing grievous hurt. The investigation continues as authorities search for two additional suspects who remain at large.

The incident has been covered extensively by media outlets, with some reports suggesting a communal angle. According to these reports, the altercation was influenced by underlying religious tensions, with claims that pro-Hindutva slogans were chanted during the match and that the attack was motivated by religious animosity.

However, local officials and community leaders have contested these claims. Deputy Superintendent of Police Jayesh Panchal stated that the communal angle reported by some media outlets is not supported by the evidence. He emphasized that the investigation has not revealed any evidence of religious incitement or slogans being involved in the incident.

Ismailbhai, a local Muslim leader, also denied any communal motive behind the attack, describing the incident as a tragic result of a parking dispute rather than religious conflict. He called for justice while downplaying the media's portrayal of the event as a communal clash.

The case highlights the complexity of interpreting violent incidents in communal contexts and underscores the importance of relying on official investigations and local perspectives to understand the underlying causes and motives.

Algerian judoka Fethi Nourine has withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics before competing after the draw set him on course for a possible match-up against an Israeli opponent. Nourine was set to face Sudanese judoka Mohamed Abdalrasool on Monday for his first bout, and would have taken on Israeli Tohar Butbul in the next round. Speaking to an Algerian television station late Thursday, Nourine said his political support for the Palestinian cause made it impossible for him to compete against an Israeli.

""We worked a lot to reach the Olympics... but the Palestinian cause is bigger than all of this,"" he said, adding that his decision was ""final"".

It is not the first time that Nourine has withdrawn from competition to avoid facing an Israeli opponent, after he pulled out of the 2019 world championships in Tokyo.

Iranian judokas have also come under fire for refusing to compete against their Israeli counterparts.

Here is the truth","Had Algerian judo player Redouane Messaoud Dris intentionally forfeited the match against Tohar Butbul for virtue of his Israeli nationality, he would have been served with a 10-year ban.

On Sunday (28th July), Islamists took to social media to hail the ‘greatness’ of an Algerian judo player named Redouane Messaoud Dris.


They branded him as a ‘hero’ for supposedly refusing to compete against Israeli judoka Tohar Butbul during the ongoing 2024 Paris  Olympics. The Islamists also claimed that his refusal to play against Butbul came in the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war and his unwavering support to Palestine.

“Algerian judoka Dris Messaoud, who was scheduled to fight against his Israeli opponent Tohar Butbul in the Paris Olympics, has withdrawn in support of Palestine and the non-normalization of the existence of the State of Israel. Legend,” tweeted ‘Suppressed News.’ While accusing Israel of committing genocide, one Islamist stated, “BREAKING: Algerian judo competitor Ka Dris Messaoud has withdrawn from the Paris Olympics because his next opponent is an Israeli and he refused to compete against an Israeli athlete while Israel commits genocide.”




Another Islamist hailed judoka Redouane Messaoud Dris as a ‘legend.’


“The right thing to do. Every athlete, every country should refuse to face off against Israel. #Paris2024,” another X handle brazened out.


“Well done Dris Messaoud. Israel should not be participating. Very unfair for the other athletes taking part.,” wrote one Sabrina


The Truth behind the viral claims
Contrary to the false bravado of Islamists on social media, Algerian judo player Redouane Messaoud Dris did not ‘refuse’ to play against his Israeli judoka over ‘Palestine’.


In reality, he was disqualified for being overweight and was not allowed to compete against his Israeli counterpart in the under-73kg judo event by the International Judo Federation (IJF).

In a statement, the Olympics officials informed, “Redouane Messaoud Driss has been disqualified…Dris, entered in the men’s -73 kg event, failed the weigh-in. Therefore his opponent Tohar Butbul will win the scheduled contest by walkover.”


Had Algerian judo player Redouane Messaoud Dris intentionally forfeited the match against Tohar Butbul for virtue of his Israeli nationality, he would have been served with a 10-year ban.

Such a precedent was laid down in the 2021 Tokyo  Olympics when another Algerian player named Fethi Nourine refused to compete and was suspended for 10 years by the International Judo Federation (IJF). His coach Amar Benikhlef also suffered the loss of accreditation.


The duo was suspended for violating the code of ethics of IJF and the  Olympic charter, which prohibits the use of Games for protest and promotion of political and religious propaganda.



",,,"Algerian Judoka Withdraws from Tokyo Olympics Over Potential Match Against Israeli Opponent

","Algerian judoka Fethi Nourine has withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics after the competition draw indicated he might face Israeli athlete Tohar Butbul in the subsequent round. Nourine was scheduled to compete against Sudanese judoka Mohamed Abdalrasool in the first round before potentially facing Butbul.

Nourine cited his support for the Palestinian cause as the primary reason behind his decision, stating that competing against an Israeli athlete would conflict with his personal beliefs. ""We worked hard to reach the Olympics, but the Palestinian cause is bigger than all of this,"" Nourine told an Algerian television station, emphasizing that his decision is ""final."" This marks the second time Nourine has opted out of a major competition to avoid an Israeli opponent, following a similar decision during the 2019 World Championships in Tokyo.

Nourine's stance has drawn both support and criticism. Supporters, particularly in the Arab world, have praised him for prioritizing his political principles, while others argue that such actions politicize sports in a way that undermines the Olympic spirit. The International Judo Federation (IJF) has previously taken a firm stance against such boycotts, suspending athletes and coaches who refuse to compete based on nationality.

The incident highlights ongoing tensions within international sports when political issues intersect with athletic competitions. While some applaud Nourine for his dedication to his beliefs, others see it as a missed opportunity for the values of inclusivity and fair play that the Olympics aim to promote.

Kolkata: The police will have time till Sunday to solve the rape-murder last week of a 31-year-old doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College, failing which the CBI will take over the case, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said Monday afternoon. The deadline for the state cops - whom Ms Banerjee backed and praised as ""the best in the world"" - comes amid intense political pressure by the BJP.
""If there are more accused... and all are not arrested by Sunday... we will hand over the case to the CBI,"" the Chief Minister said after meeting the family of the victim, and threw in a swipe at the federal agency, which reports to the BJP.

""... we will hand over even though their success rate is low,"" she said, referring to cases taken by the CBI, like the theft of Rabindranath Tagore's Nobel Prize, but which had seen ""no justice till date..""

Last week too, the Chief Minister said she has no objection to the CBI - which reports to the BJP-led union government - taking charge of this case, particularly if that was the demand of protesting medical professionals. ""... if agitating students want probe by another agency, we are not against it.""

Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal, speaking after Ms Banerjee's deadline, outlined steps being taken by the cops to solve this crime. ""We are certain... in the next four or five days, if there are more culprits, we will be able to arrest them,"" he said, ""We have started a helpline... doctors can give information by calling (and) can communicate anonymously... if they have suspicions.""

""We are in touch with family members. We will stay in touch and share progress with them... If, even after that, family is not satisfied then whatever madam (Ms Banerjee) has said will happen,"" he said.

The doctor was found on Friday morning in the seminar hall of the state-run hospital.

The initial autopsy report said the victim was bleeding from her eyes, mouth, and private parts, as also on her left leg, neck, right hand, ring finger and lips. Sanjoy Roy, a civic volunteer who frequented the hospital, has been arrested in connection with the crime. The incident has sparked nationwide protests by doctors and the political opposition. The man, Sanjoy Roy, had returned to his place and went to sleep before washing his clothes the next morning to destroy evidence, a police officer probing the case claimed.

This morning the Principal, Dr Sandip Ghosh, who has been accused of victim-blaming, resigned, declaring that he ""cannot take the humiliation"" and alleged ""political statements"" against him. ""Students are being provoked to ensure my removal. I want the accused to be punished. I am being defamed. I have not made such remarks,"" he told the media this morning. ""The girl who died was like my daughter. I am also a parent. As a parent, I am resigning,"" he said.

Earlier, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari had targeted Dr Ghosh and demanded his suspension.

""His misleading statements and carefree attitude in the aftermath of this tragic incident expose his indifference towards the victim,"" Mr Adhikari said in a post on X.

Meanwhile, doctors from hospitals across India have announced an indefinite strike. Doctors in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and other cities have said all elective services will be halted till a probe is completed. The protesters are also demanding adequate security for all medical staff.

And now the same Mamata Banerjee has announced protests demanding quick justice from CBI.

As protests have erupted in the entire country over the brutal rape and murder of 32-year-old trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has announced protests demanding punishment for the culprit. Notably, the govt run hospital had tried everything to hide the crime, labelling it as suicide and ‘renovating’ the crime scene.


Mamata Banerjee announced that on 17 August, her party will organise a protest march in all the blocks demanding the punishment of the criminal. Then on 18 August, there will be a demonstration in all the blocks and on 19th August, on the day of Raksha Bandhan, a program to demand capital punishment of the guilty will be organised.

As the case has been handed over to the CBI by the Calcutta High Court, the CM demanded that the CBI should “ensure justice within next Sunday”.

The Trinamool Congress chief said she will hold a rally from Moulali to Dharmtala in Kolkata on August 17. She said, “I want the accused to be hanged. I hope the CBI will give justice within next Sunday.”


Earlier on August 12, Mamata Banerjee had told the state police that the case would be handed over to CBI if they can’t crack the case by Sunday, 18 August. But even before that deadline on 11 August, the Calcutta High Court transferred the case to CBI. Mamata Banerjee also welcomed the Calcutta High Court order.

The CM also accused the opposition BJP and CPI(M) of running a malicious campaign against her government over the incident. “What have we not done? What action did we not take? As soon as I came to know of the incident, I spoke to the police commissioner and spoke to the parents,” Mamata Banerjee said.

Notably, while Mamata Banerjee wants CBI to hang the culprit by Sunday, her govt is accused of shielding the culprit in the case. After the semi-nude body of PG trainee doctor was found inside the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College on 9th August, the hospital administration told her family that she had committed suicide. It is believed that the college administration tried to cover up the crime by terming it as a suicide.

Later the autopsy report confirmed sexual assault on the victim, apart from multiple injury marks on the body.


But the suspected attempt to protect the culprit continued even after that. The medical college authority demolished the walls of the Chest Medicine Dept, where the girl was raped and murdered, in the name of renovation. BJP has alleged that the state was trying to tamper with the evidence in the case by breaking the walls.

In another shocking development, the principal was reinstated in a plum post after he said that the woman died by suicide. Dr Sandip Ghosh resigned from the post of principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Monday amid massive protests over the rape and murder. But he was immediately appointed as the principal of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital (CNMCH) on the same day.

The Calcutta High Court strongly objected to this and ordered him to submit his resignation and go on leave.

Notably, it is alleged that Dr Sandip Ghosh has close ties with the TMC. In May last year, he was transferred to Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital. But he locked the principal’s room, and prevented the new principal from joining duty. The state govt then revoked the transfer order within 2 days. Then in September 2023, he was transferred to Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital from RG Kar Medical College. But he was transferred back to RG Kar Medical College within a month.


The High Court transferred the case to CBI because it was not satisfied with the progress made by the state police under the Mamata Banerjee government. And now the same Mamata Banerjee has announced protests demanding quick justice from CBI.

",,,"Kolkata Doctor's Murder Sparks Controversy and Protests Amid Political and Investigative Tensions

","The recent rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College have ignited widespread protests and brought political scrutiny to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's administration. The case has been marked by intense demands for justice, with the investigation being transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) following a directive from the Calcutta High Court.

The victim, a postgraduate trainee, was found dead on August 9 in the seminar hall of the state-run medical college. The initial autopsy revealed signs of sexual assault, along with multiple injury marks on her body. The incident has prompted nationwide protests by medical professionals, demanding swift action and better security in hospitals.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, facing criticism for the state police’s handling of the case, initially set a deadline of August 18 for the police to arrest all those involved. However, the Calcutta High Court preemptively handed over the case to the CBI on August 11, citing concerns over the progress made by the state authorities. In response, Ms. Banerjee expressed her willingness to support the CBI probe, while also questioning the federal agency’s track record in solving high-profile cases, such as the unresolved theft of Rabindranath Tagore's Nobel Prize.

The case has sparked significant political debate, with opposition parties, particularly the BJP, accusing the state government of attempting to shield the perpetrators. The controversy deepened when the principal of RG Kar Medical College, Dr. Sandip Ghosh, was accused of victim-blaming and was later reinstated in another prominent position despite public outcry. Dr. Ghosh has since resigned under pressure, but his rapid appointment to a new role raised further allegations of political favoritism.

The Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by Mamata Banerjee, has organized protest marches demanding justice, with the Chief Minister publicly calling for the accused to face the death penalty. The TMC has planned rallies across the state from August 17-19, framing the issue as one of justice for the victim while countering claims of administrative negligence.

Meanwhile, medical professionals across India have announced indefinite strikes, halting elective services until their demands for a thorough investigation and improved safety measures are met. The protests underscore the rising tensions between healthcare workers, who feel increasingly vulnerable, and political forces vying to control the narrative surrounding the incident.

As the CBI takes over, the focus remains on whether the investigation will lead to a resolution that satisfies both the victim’s family and the public, while navigating the political ramifications that have come to define the case.

In her first presidential address after the formation of the BJP-led NDA government for the third time at the Centre, the president said that the newly formed NDA government's first budget will be futuristic and will facilitate fast-tracked reforms. 

She said, “In the upcoming sessions, this government is going to present the first budget of this term. This budget will be an effective document of the government's far-reaching policies and futuristic vision. Along with big economic and social decisions, many historic steps will also be seen in this budget.”

The opposition parties raised slogans against the center's policies during the address. Key issues addressed included the Manipur violence, NEET paper leak, and new criminal laws set to come into force in July against which the slogans were raised.Here are the key takeaways of the President's address:
1. In her opening address of the 18th Lok Sabha, President Murmu invoked Emergency calling it ""an attack on the Constitution and a source of chaos and panic in the country"". 

""The Constitution of India withstood all hurdles that came it's way when it was being formulated and implemented. It also overcame attacks that it faced after independence, in the form of National Emergency imposed in the country 50 years ago,"" she said.

2. Referring to the recent irregularities in the NEET-UG examination and other paper leaks, President Murmu said that the government is committed to a fair investigation of the recent incidents of paper leaks as well as stringent punishment for the guilty. 

""It is a continuous effort of the government to ensure that the youth of the country gets adequate opportunity to display their talent. My government is committed to a fair investigation of the recent incidents of paper leaks as well as stringent punishment for the guilty. Even before this, we have seen paper leaks in different states. Rising above partisan politics, a nationwide concrete solution is needed for this. Parliament has formed a strict law against irregularities in examinations.""


3. Amid concerns raised over Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) by the opposition, President Murmu praised the EVMs in her address and said the ""misinformation campaign was unfortunate"". 

She said EVMs were used in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls ""to ensure the sanctity of the electoral process"" and praised the Election Commission of India for holding the ""largest election in the world"". ""The EVM has passed every test, from the Supreme Court to the people's court, in the last few decades,"" she said.


4. The president further highlighted that the process of reforms in the Armed Forces should continue to keep it combat-ready. ""For a capable India, modernity in our armed forces is essential. We should be the best in the face of war - to ensure this, the process of reforms should go on continuously in the armed forces. With this mindset, my government took several important steps in the last 10 years. With reforms, India is indulging in defence manufacturing of more than ₹1 lakh crore. In the last 1 decade, our defence exports have increased by 18 times and touched ₹21,000 crores,"" President Murmu said.


5. The president also highlighted the high voter turnout in Jammu and Kashmir in the Lok Sabha elections and said Kashmir has given a befitting reply to the enemies of India by breaking polling records of many decades. 

""Enemies of India continued to spread false propaganda at global fora, projecting it as the opinion of Jammu and Kashmir. But this time, the Kashmir Valley has given a befitting reply to every such element within the country and outside,"" the President said.

6. President Murmu also highlighted the fact that today's India provides solutions for global issues ranging from climate change to food security and from nutrition to sustainable agriculture. 

She said that India achieved its climate-related targets much ahead of schedule and the country's initiatives to become a Net Zero economy are an inspiration for many countries. 


""We are providing various solutions for issues ranging from climate change to food security and from nutrition to sustainable agriculture. We are also running a campaign to popularise our coarse grains – Shree Anna – as a superfood across the world. On India’s initiative, the year 2023 was celebrated as the International Year of Millets worldwide,"" she said.

7. She also said that now India is changing its agriculture system keeping in mind its current needs. ""My government has provided ₹3.20 lakh crores to the farmers of the country under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Since the beginning of the new term of my government, an amount of more than ₹20,000 crores has been transferred to the farmers. The government has also made a record increase in the MSP for Kharif crops. Today's India is changing its agriculture system keeping in mind its current needs,"" the President said.


8. Cautioning against disruptive forces conspiring to weaken democracy and create fissures in society, President said new ways and means were needed to address this challenge. 

""In this era of communication revolution, disruptive forces are conspiring to weaken democracy and create fissures in the society. These forces are present within the country and are also operating from outside the country,"" she said. Murmu said such disruptive forces resort to rumour-mongering, misleading the people.



9. She also hailed the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) saying that it will prove to be one of the ""biggest game-changers"" of the 21st century. Murmu also said that the global order is taking a ""new shape"" and that the government's efforts are resulting in ""Bharat"" giving a new confidence to the world as a ""Vishwa-Bandhu"" (friend of the world).

Kejriwal's arrest stems from a broader investigation into the Delhi government's excise policy, which has already seen multiple arrests, including former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha. The CBI has filed four charge sheets in the case, naming 17 accused persons, although Kejriwal has not been indicted yet.

During the hearing, Kejriwal's lawyer, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, requested that the court direct the CBI to submit all relevant evidence. Singhvi also highlighted that the Supreme Court had previously granted Kejriwal interim bail and criticized the timing of his arrest.

The CBI claims that a portion of the ₹100 crore allegedly received by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as kickbacks was transferred to Goa for election campaign purposes via 'hawala channels.'

JD(U) reiterates demand for special status for Bihar at key meet
Calls for increased reservation for backward classes
Party backs Nitish Kumar’s leadership
The Janata Dal (United) held its national executive meeting in Delhi on Saturday, with party supremo and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar resolving to push for special category status for the state, according to sources.

The call for special category status for Bihar assumes significance at this time because Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP relies on support from Kumar’s JD(U), which holds 12 seats in the newly elected Lok Sabha, to maintain power at the Centre.
With Kumar chairing the event, key decisions and demands emerged from the meeting, which was attended by all party MPs, including Union ministers and JD(U) leaders. Sanjay Jha, the party's Rajya Sabha MP, was elected as the JD(U) working president.

Special Category Status for Bihar
JD(U) insiders revealed that the party has resolved to seek special category status for Bihar, a long-standing demand, from the central government. The demand was reiterated in the political proposal presented during the meeting. A special financial package for the state may also be sought.
This comes after the Bihar Cabinet passed a resolution demanding special status for the state last year.
Bihar’s politicians, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, have long advocated for special category status, citing the state’s economic backwardness. Achieving this status would boost the state's share of tax revenues from the Centre.
Reservation Demands
Additionally, the JD(U) has sought that the central government include the increased reservation for the Other Backward Classes, Extremely Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes in the Ninth Schedule, despite the Patna High Court setting aside the Bihar government's decision to give 65 per cent quota to backward classes based on the state's first-ever caste survey.
Leadership and Assembly Elections
The national executive expressed full faith in Nitish Kumar's leadership and resolved to move forward with the upcoming assembly elections under his guidance. Bihar is expected to vote for its 243-member legislative assembly in October 2025. The party plans to field candidates in the 2024 Jharkhand elections and is preparing to fight the elections strongly.
The executive also stressed the need for ministers in the central and state governments to maintain communication with workers, ensuring that information about their programmes reaches the booth level.
In the political proposal, Nitish Kumar was congratulated for the party's victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections. The meeting also extended congratulations to PM Modi for the victory of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections.
The meeting marked an important step in the party's efforts to strengthen its organisation and prepare for upcoming elections, with a focus on Bihar's development and the party's national presence.",,,"JD(U) Pushes for Special Status for Bihar in National Executive Meeting

New Delhi: The Janata Dal United (JD(U)) concluded its national executive meeting on Saturday, where the party, led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, reaffirmed its longstanding demand for special category status for the state. The resolution highlights the economic and developmental challenges faced by Bihar, emphasizing the need for enhanced support from the central government.

JD(U) leaders argued that granting special status to Bihar is essential for accelerating the state’s growth and addressing its unique issues. ""The demand for special status is not new, but it remains crucial for addressing Bihar’s development needs and economic disparities,"" a senior JD(U) leader stated after the meeting.

In addition to the special status demand, the party called for the inclusion of Bihar’s increased reservation quota—now set at 65 percent for various backward classes—into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. This move is aimed at protecting the quota from judicial review and ensuring its implementation.

The JD(U) also expressed concerns over recent irregularities in the NEET examination, calling for a comprehensive investigation to restore the credibility of the examination process and maintain public trust.

Strategic Importance and Future Plans

The meeting underscored the political significance of the JD(U) in the current political landscape, particularly its role in supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP government. With JD(U) holding 12 seats in the Lok Sabha, the party's support is pivotal for the BJP's stability at the Centre.

The JD(U) also discussed its future electoral strategy, including preparation for the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar and the 2024 Jharkhand elections. The party expressed confidence in Nitish Kumar’s leadership and outlined plans to strengthen its organization and communication at the grassroots level.

President Droupadi Murmu also condemned Emergency in her address to joint sitting of both houses of Parliament.

“The Constitution of India withstood all hurdles that came it's way when it was being formulated and implemented. It also overcame attacks that it faced after independence, in the form of National Emergency imposed in the country 50 years ago,” she had said.

Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) made the announcement in a gazette notification saying, ""a proclamation of Emergency was made on 25th June 1975, following which there was gross abuse of power by the government of the day and people of India were subjected to excesses and atrocities"".

Soon after MHA announced the notification, Union Minister Amit Shah on Friday said that June 35 will remind us of the immense contribution of all those people who suffered during the time of emergency.

Amit Shah shared a notification on his social media site X which reads, ""Whereas, people of India have abiding faith in the Constitution of India and the power of India's resilient democracy; Therefore, Government of India declares 25 June as 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas' to pay tribute to all those who suffered and fought against the gross abuse of power during the period of Emergency and to recommit the people of India to not support in any manner such gross abuse of power, in future"".

The announcement, made through a gazette notification by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), aims to honor those who suffered under the Emergency and to reinforce a commitment to safeguarding democratic values.

The proclamation of Emergency by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975, led to widespread suppression, including the imprisonment of thousands and restrictions on the press. The Emergency lasted for 18 months, during which civil liberties were curtailed and democratic processes were undermined.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah emphasized the significance of the day, stating, ""June 25 will serve as a reminder of the severe abuses of power that occurred during the Emergency. This day will honor those who suffered and highlight the importance of protecting our democracy against any form of authoritarianism.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also supported the designation, calling it a necessary step to remember a ""dark phase"" in Indian history imposed by the Congress-led government of the time. He reiterated that this day would also pay homage to those who fought against the violations of democratic principles during that period.

The move comes amidst renewed political debates over historical events. Following the announcement, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticized the BJP's focus on the Emergency, suggesting it as a diversion from current political issues. Ramesh proposed June 4 as a ‘Modi Mukti Diwas’, referring to a day he views as symbolizing a political defeat for the Prime Minister.

The ex-Law Minister also claimed the Congress is ""involved in creating economic instability and anarchy"" and ""hatred against India"".
He also underlined India's position as a ""safe, stable and promising market"".

Ravi Shankar Prasad's scathing comments come a day after party colleagues Rajeev Chandrasekhar launched a similar attack on the Congress, declaring the party is ""seeking foreign help to discredit (and) destabilise our financial markets and to create chaos in the country... by spreading anarchy"".


""After losing for a third time (referring to the 2024 general election) and the Congress and its closest 'toolkit' allies now want to make the Indian economy unstable. Congress today has developed hatred against India. What Congress wants is to bring back 'control Raj'..."" Mr Prasad said.

""This report was released on Saturday... they raised this aggressively on Sunday so the stock market can take a hit,"" he continued, ""Politics of Congress has 'toolkit' and 'chit politics'.""


""We are proud the Indian stock market is stable today. We want to salute small investors... this basically means they do not believe in the 'toolkit' and the Hindenburg report,"" Mr Prasad raged.

""Recycled..."": Hindenburg Claims Trashed

Last week United States-based Hindenburg released a new report claiming Securities Exchange Board of India chief Madhabi Puri Buch had a stake in obscure offshore entities used in alleged financial wrongdoing by the Adani Group. The allegations have been slammed by the company, the markets body, and industry leaders as ""recycled claims... proven baseless by the Supreme Court"".

""For a discredited short-seller under the scanner for several violations of Indian securities laws, Hindenburg's allegations are no more than red herrings thrown by a desperate entity with total contempt for Indian laws,"" the Adani Group said last week in an exchange filing.


From her side Madhabi Puri Buch has strongly denied the latest report as ""baseless allegations and insinuations"". Her husband called it an attempted ""character assassination"" after action against the short-seller; in July, SEBI flagged violations by Hindenburg and its sole owner, Nathan Anderson.

""Congress Wants Stock Market To Crash""

Mr Prasad this afternoon also questioned the Congress' failure to take part in earlier legal processes involving Hindenburg Research and its allegations.

""Earlier too report was released... then legal process was followed. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress, who talk about joint parliamentary committees, should have taken part..."" Mr Prasad declared.

Hindenburg's earlier allegations - about claims of price manipulation - provoked a furious political row too but were dismissed by the Supreme Court, which said it found no regulatory failures.

""SEBI sent a notice but instead of responding Hindenburg is making baseless allegations. A proper reply has been given (now) by SEBI and its Chairperson.""

""Now they (the Congress) are (again) demanding a JPC probe... they want India's stock market to crash. They don't want small investors to thrive..."" the senior BJP leader claimed.
""BJP wants to say... with full sense of responsibility... that Congress and its leadership is involved in creating economic anarchy in India based upon a fictitious report. What does the Congress want?""

""Why Personally Invested?""

The BJP's Amit Malviya attacked the Congress and senior leader Rahul Gandhi, claiming the Lok Sabha MP ""holds 43 per cent of his total declared assets in Indian stocks... that is a lot of faith...""


""(Mr) Gandhi's movable assets grew by 59 per cent over 2019. This was possible because the economy, despite all odds, performed very well... but he is fear-mongering and dissuading retail investors from participating in wealth creation..."" Mr Malviya claimed.

Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, senior party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad reiterated the party line that the short-selling firm's charge and the Opposition's criticism of the Sebi chairperson were part of a wider conspiracy. He claimed that billionaire investor George Soros is an investor in Hindenburg and is known for running a propaganda against the Narendra Modi-led government.

""After being rebuffed by the people, the Congress, its allies and its closest ally in the toolkit gang have conspired together to usher in economic anarchy and instability in India,"" he told reporters.
The Congress rule between 2004 and 2014 was marked by several alleged scams, Prasad noted, as he questioned why such critical reports were not brought out then.

The controversy intensified following Hindenburg Research's latest report, which included claims of financial misconduct involving the Adani Group and alleged connections to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch. The Adani Group and SEBI have dismissed these claims as ""recycled"" and baseless, with SEBI recently flagging violations by Hindenburg.

Prasad also criticized Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other party members for their response to the allegations. He suggested that the Congress's criticism of the Indian financial system was driven by political motives and aimed at destabilizing the economy.

""The Congress wants to project a false image of economic instability in India,"" Prasad continued. ""They have shown a pathological hatred towards the Prime Minister and are using this report to further their agenda.""

The BJP's statements come amid heightened scrutiny and political debate over the Hindenburg report. The Congress, on its part, has been vocal in demanding a thorough investigation into the allegations, accusing the ruling party of deflecting from the core issues raised by the report.

As the political discourse continues, both parties remain engaged in a heated exchange over the implications of the Hindenburg allegations and their impact on India's financial markets.",,,

The ED informed the court that “huge amounts of money collected through crowdfunding by Gokhale have been squandered on speculative share trading, dining, and other personal expenses, which appear to be extravagant in nature.” Gokhale, however, denied any misuse of the funds.
However, a special court granted regular bail to Gokhale in May of last year, in a money laundering case related to alleged irregularities.

Earlier in July, the Delhi High Court ordered Saket Gokhale to pay ₹50 lakhs in damages to Lakshmi Puri wife of Union Minister Hardeep Puri for defamation.
This came after Lakshmi Puri filed a defamation suit against Gokhale for making harmful statements on social media.
The case arose from a series of tweets and public statements by Gokhale that Lakshmi Puri claimed were false and harmful to her reputation.

The money laundering case against Gokhale originates from a Gujarat Police FIR related to the alleged misuse of funds he collected through crowdfunding.
In a social media post on ‘X’ Enforcement Directorate (ED) said, “The Hon’ble Principal District and Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad (Rural) and Designated Special Court (PMLA), Ahmedabad, today i.e. 13.08.2024 framed the Criminal Charges against Saket Gokhale, M.P., Rajya Sabha and National Spokespersons of All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) under the provisions of PMLA, 2002 in Prosecution Complaint filed by ED.

**Ahmedabad:** A special court in Gujarat's Ahmedabad has framed criminal charges against Saket Gokhale, a Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament and national spokesperson, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002. The charges stem from allegations of financial misconduct related to funds raised through crowdfunding, which were purportedly misused.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) announced on Tuesday that the Principal District and Sessions Judge of Ahmedabad (Rural), who also serves as the Designated Special Court for PMLA cases, has formally charged Gokhale in connection with a case initiated by the Gujarat Police. The case alleges that Gokhale misused funds he had collected through crowdfunding, directing them towards speculative share trading, dining, and other personal expenses, which the ED described as ""extravagant in nature.""

Gokhale was arrested by Gujarat Police in December 2022 in Delhi on charges related to the alleged misuse of these funds. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that the funds were not misused for personal gain. Despite these denials, the special PMLA court has moved forward with the case, framing charges against Gokhale.

In an earlier development, Gokhale was granted regular bail by the special court in May 2023, in connection with the same money laundering case. However, the court's decision to frame charges indicates that the legal proceedings against him are far from over.

Additionally, Gokhale has faced legal challenges outside of the money laundering allegations. In July 2024, the Delhi High Court ordered him to pay ₹50 lakhs in damages to Lakshmi Puri, the wife of Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, in a defamation case. The court's ruling was based on a series of tweets and public statements made by Gokhale, which Puri claimed were defamatory and caused significant harm to her reputation.

The ongoing legal battles and the recent framing of charges under the PMLA represent a significant challenge for Gokhale and the TMC, as the case has drawn considerable attention from both the public and political spheres. As the proceedings continue, the case will likely have broader implications for the political landscape, particularly concerning the use of crowdfunding and the scrutiny of public figures' financial dealings.",,,

Kolkata, Aug 14: The Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Wednesday launched a scathing attack against the West Bengal government on the heinous rape and murder of a junior doctor at state-run RG Kar Medical College & Hospital last week.

“The attempt to save the accused instead of providing justice to the victim raises serious questions on the hospital and the local administration.


“This incident has forced us to think that if doctors are not safe in a place like a medical college, then how can parents send their daughters outside for studies?

“Why are even the strict laws made after the Nirbhaya case unsuccessful in preventing such crimes?” LoP Rahul Gandhi said in a strong statement posted on his official X handle.

According to him, the RG Kar incident is bound to create an atmosphere of insecurity in the medical fraternity and women.

“The entire country is shocked by the gruesome incident of rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata. The way the layers of the cruel and inhuman act against her are being revealed, there is an atmosphere of insecurity among the doctors’ community and women,” Rahul Gandhi commented.

“Every party, every section of society will have to hold serious discussions and take concrete steps on the continuously increasing incidents against women from Hathras to Unnao, and from Kathua to Kolkata,” he added while emphasising that the culprits in the case should be given such a punishment that it is presented as an example in society.

Political observers said that this post by the Congress MP is quite significant especially in the backdrop of his sister and Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s recent post in the matter, just appealing to the West Bengal government to take immediate and strict action in the case.

“I appeal to the state government to take immediate and strict action in this case and ensure justice to the victim’s family and fellow doctors,” her post on X read.

The BJP has been questioning the silence of Rahul Gandhi on the issue. While now Rahul Gandhi has reacted to the brutal case, he stopped short from criticising the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government in West Bengal and only pointed fingers at the medical college and local administration. 

A post-graduate trainee doctor was found dead inside the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on August 9. An investigation has established rape and murder. Reportedly, the body of the deceased bore scratch marks, indicating that there was some struggle at the time of the incident.

**Kolkata:** The recent rape and murder of a junior doctor at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata have sparked widespread outrage, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi demanding swift justice for the victim's family. The case, which has drawn comparisons to the infamous Nirbhaya incident, has raised serious concerns about the safety of women and the adequacy of laws designed to protect them.

In a statement posted on his official social media handle, Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, criticized the handling of the case by local authorities. He questioned the actions of the hospital administration and the state government, implying that there were attempts to shield the accused rather than deliver justice.

""The entire country is shocked by the gruesome incident of rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata. The way the layers of this cruel and inhuman act are being revealed has created an atmosphere of insecurity among the medical community and women,"" Gandhi stated. He further emphasized the need for a serious national discourse on the rising incidents of violence against women, drawing parallels to other high-profile cases across the country.

Gandhi expressed solidarity with the victim's family, stating, ""I stand with the victim's family in this unbearable pain. They should get justice at all costs, and the culprits should be given such a punishment that it serves as an example in society."" He also raised concerns about the safety of female students, asking, ""If doctors are not safe in a place like a medical college, how can parents feel confident in sending their daughters out for studies?""

The incident, which occurred on August 9, has been confirmed as a case of rape and murder, with investigators noting signs of a struggle on the victim's body. The case has now been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by the Calcutta High Court, reflecting the gravity of the crime and the public demand for an impartial probe.

The BJP has criticized Gandhi for not directly condemning the Mamata Banerjee-led state government, suggesting that his focus on the hospital and local administration was an attempt to avoid political confrontation. However, Gandhi's remarks highlight broader concerns about the effectiveness of existing laws in preventing such crimes and the urgent need for collective action across political lines to address the safety of women.

This tragic incident has once again brought the issue of women's safety to the forefront of national discourse, with calls for stronger enforcement of laws and greater accountability for those responsible for ensuring public safety. The outcome of the investigation and the subsequent legal proceedings will be closely watched, as the country grapples with the implications of yet another horrific crime against a young woman.",,,

Union minister and Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar alleged a coverup by the Trinamool Congress, questioning why female TMC MPs are maintaining a silence on the case. He also talked about purported screenshots of WhatsApp chats from the doctor's team which mentioned drugs and a sex racket.
“In the doctor's team, many such topics have come up in their WhatsApp group, some screenshots of this have also reached us like drugs, racket, sex racket.

Union Minister and Bengal BJP President Sukanta Majumdar has accused the ruling party of attempting to cover up the crime, questioning why TMC leaders, especially its female MPs, have remained silent.

During a press conference, Majumdar highlighted disturbing revelations that have come to light, including screenshots of WhatsApp chats from the doctor's team, which allegedly mention drugs and a sex racket. These chats, according to Majumdar, repeatedly reference the name of a TMC MP and his nephew, raising suspicions about their possible connection to the crime.

""In the doctor's team, many such topics have come up in their WhatsApp group, some screenshots of this have also reached us like drugs, racket, sex racket. The names of a TMC MP and his nephew are coming up again and again, I don't know what happened but something is wrong,” Majumdar stated, underscoring the gravity of the allegations.

The BJP leader did not mince words when he criticized the silence of TMC's female MPs, some of whom are alumni of the same medical college where the victim studied. ""Despite having so many women MPs in TMC, not a single woman MP said much on this issue. Even one TMC MP, three MLAs, two have studied from the same medical college but some cello tape has been put on their mouths as well..."" he added, implying that there is a deliberate effort to suppress the truth.

Majumdar's statements have intensified the ongoing political battle between the BJP and the TMC, with the former demanding a thorough investigation and accountability. The BJP's allegations come at a time when the state is already under scrutiny for law and order issues, and this case only adds to the list of concerns about the safety and security of citizens under the current regime.

The BJP's call for justice resonates with the public's demand for transparency and fairness, especially in a case as heinous as this. The involvement of political figures, if proven true, would not only be a massive scandal but also a severe breach of public trust.

The West Bengal government must now answer these serious allegations, ensuring that those responsible, irrespective of their political affiliations, are brought to justice. The people of Bengal deserve to know the truth, and the BJP is committed to ensuring that this case is not swept under the rug.",,,,,,,

Swamy alleged that it violated Article 9 of the Constitution of India and the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955. According to the report, the home ministry on April 29, 2019 had written to Rahul Gandhi and asked him to put forward the factual position in this regard within a fortnight. 

The BJP alleged that even after five years since his letter, there is no clarity on the home ministry on the decision taken on Rahul Gandhi.

Rahul Gandhi has been an MP for five terms, having represented Amethi for three terms between 2004 till 2019 when he was defeated by BJP's Smriti Irani. He was elected from Kerala's Wayanad.

Rahul Gandhi, elected as an MP from Congress bastion Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, is the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha. The grand old party is the largest member of the INDIA bloc with 99 seats. The Congress got the leader of opposition post after a gap of 10 years.

Modi, sources told ET, said eight subgroups would be formed on the lines of his priority areas comprising secretaries of different departments.

These groups would have to give their recommendations in a time-bound manner, leading to the creation of a grand action plan. The PM is believed to have laid emphasis on “product, process and delivery”.
He told the top babus that his emphasis in 2016 would be on execution and delivery as that’s what “citizens judge”.
A bureaucrat, who did not wish to named, said the PM asked them to focus on faster implementation of projects. “He advised us not to bother about the state of politics. If there is a good practice in any state, we must adopt it.”

The interaction lasted for over an hour and included Union ministers Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari, besides senior officers of the Cabinet Secretariat and the PMO. In course of the interaction, the prime minister also appreciated the work done by the top babus and said it should now be leveraged to bring about “breakthroughs, rather than incremental change”.

The PM is said to have urged the secretaries to “prioritise schemes, set targets and formulate a monitoring framework”. As a top babu put it: “He told us the vision for the country is ready, and now is the time for execution. The talk was aimed at getting us enthusiastic about work.”
The eight thrust areas are: good governance, employment generation, education and health, farmer-centric initiatives, innovative budgeting, accelerated inclusive growth, Swachh Bharat and Ganga rejuvenation; and energy efficiency. It is learnt that subgroups of secretaries will have to give their reports in the next two weeks.

“We have been asked to share ideas, and encourage convergence and not work in silos,” a bureaucrat said. The PM is said to have spoken at length about improving the state of agriculture and is said to have told the secretaries that eastern India should be the focus of the next green revolution. A secretary said the PM also asked them to look at energy efficiency in whichever offices they work in and set an example for others. “He said the budget should not just be a statement of account but more than that.”

https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/the-ucc-what-the-prime-minister-said-and-could-only-say,The UCC: What the Prime Minister said — and could only say,"In 15 years of BJP rule, we are yet to see a draft of this secular civil code or uniform civil code. Yet here we go again, 100 years after the RSS was founded

Narendra Modi (left) and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, both committed to the UCC promise—can they fulfil it?Narendra Modi (left) and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, both committed to the UCC promise—can they fulfil it?

In his 15 August address, the prime minister said his government would work towards changing India’s personal laws. He said, “After 75 years of a communal civil code, it is crucial to move towards a secular civil code. Once this shift takes place, it will eliminate religious discrimination and will bridge the gap felt by ordinary citizens.”

Personal laws govern marriage, divorce and inheritance in India. The BJP has had a curious relationship with this subject, from the very founding of the republic. Dr B.R. Ambedkar had proposed modest changes to Hindu personal law, especially on the question of inheritance by women. He identified the two dominant forms of traditional inheritance law and modified one of them to make inheritance fairer to women. This was not acceptable to the RSS’s political ideology.

In its 1951 manifesto, the Jana Sangh opposed the Hindu Code Bill, saying social reform should not be imposed from above but emerge from within society. In 1957, it said that such changes were not acceptable unless rooted in the ancient culture. ‘Riotous individualism’ would result. In its manifesto of 1958, the party wrote: ‘Joint family and indissoluble marriage have been the basis of Hindu society. Laws that alter this basis will ultimately lead to the disintegration of society. Jana Sangh will therefore repeal the Hindu Marriage and Hindu Succession Acts.’


Over time, as nuclear families became common and divorce became acceptable in society, the party dropped this position without explaining why.
In its 1967 manifesto, the Jana Sangh called for a uniform civil code. From here, it has appeared in all the party’s manifestos. The party promised its voters it would enforce it if it came to power. The BJP had an absolute majority in 2014 and 2019. In both elections, it had promised a uniform civil code in its manifesto but it did not legislate one or even produce a draft of it.

Now that the party has been reduced to 240, the promise has been made again; but who is to fulfil it? Where is the draft law from Modi and his ministers? It does not exist, of course. In the 15 years that this country has seen a BJP government, there has been no draft, only speeches.

The reason no draft exists is that it is not an easy problem to solve. For the BJP and its votaries, the ‘uniform civil code’ or ‘secular civil code’ is a placeholder for the abolition of polygamy. But to get rid of it, the BJP will have to target more than just Muslims. Conundrums relating to the Hindu Undivided Family are not the only ones that must be resolved.

Most citizens are now familiar with Article 370, which the BJP had long targeted and has successfully gutted in 2019; but fewer pay attention to the very next article, 371, which says ‘no Act of Parliament in respect of religious or social practices of the Nagas (and) Naga customary law and procedure… shall apply to the State of Nagaland unless the Legislative Assembly of Nagaland by a resolution so decides’.

What, then, happens to a ‘secular civil code’ that is against Naga custom? We do not know. The BJP doesn’t either.
In March 2018, the Nagaland Bar Association submitted a memorandum to Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, saying several central laws pertaining to personal law in the state are ‘badly contradictory and opposed to the Naga social customs and practices. Apart from the provisions of Article 371A of the Constitution of India, legislative power in matters of personal law is vested with the State Legislature’.


The laws mentioned were the Indian Succession Act, 1925; the Special Marriage Act, 1954; the Indian Divorce Act, 1869; the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886; the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890; and the Family Courts Act, 1984. The Bar Association said these laws ‘are required to be substituted by our own state acts’.

Similar provisions in Article 371 safeguard customary law for Mizos (371G).
Two things need to be considered now. First, there is no point in opposing or even commenting on the prime minister’s call for a uniform or secular civil code till he produces a draft. He must be encouraged to show it, even if he is not pressed to explain why he didn’t write and pass the law in the 10 years that his party had a majority in Parliament.

The Opposition and the communities threatened by the speech should consider holding back their response till they see what, if anything, he actually produces other than talk.

The second thing to consider is why he is raising the topic again at all, given that his party is now in a minority.

Why, similarly, was the Waqf Bill introduced when it was obvious that a BJP at 240 seats could not get it passed and that its allies were not interested in furthering its Hindutva agenda? Why was a Broadcast Bill — aimed at throttling such people as Ravish Kumar and Dhruv Rathee — written when, again, it was clear that it would run into trouble?

Both these proposed laws have run headlong into the reality of India after 4 June 2024. The speech on a secular civil code shows no understanding of the meaning of this last election and rather highlights the fading of the prime minister’s halo.


It shows no acceptance of the real new India, and so the government continues writing cheques its parliamentary minority cannot cash.

Invoking the Constitution and the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch Thursday for the Uniform Civil Code, saying it’s time the country moves towards a civil code that is “secular” and not “communal” and “discriminatory” as the existing one.
Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 78th Independence Day, the Prime Minister said, “In our country, the Supreme Court has repeatedly discussed the Uniform Civil Code. Many times orders have been given because a large section of the country believes — and there is truth in it — that the Civil Code that we are living with is actually a kind of Communal Civil Code, a discriminatory Civil Code.”
“When we are celebrating 75 years of the Constitution, and the spirit of the Constitution also tells us to do what the Supreme Court of the country tells us to do, it is the responsibility of all of us to fulfil the dream of the Constitution makers. I believe there should be a discussion in the country on this serious issue, it should be a wide discussion. Everyone should come up with their views. The laws which divide the country on the basis of religion, which become the reason for discrimination, such laws cannot have any place in modern society,” he said.

“I say it is the need of the hour that there should be a Secular Civil Code in the country. We have spent 75 years under the Communal Civil Code. Now we will have to move towards a Secular Civil Code. Only then we will get relief from the discrimination happening on the basis of religion in the country, from which common citizens feel distanced,” he said.
This was the first time Modi spoke on the issue of UCC in an Independence Day speech. The UCC promise has long figured in BJP election manifestos and its 2024 Lok Sabha election manifesto said “Article 44 of the Constitution lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy. BJP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time Bharat adopts a Uniform Civil Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draw a Uniform Civil Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonising them with the modern times.”

EXPLAINED
The last of BJP’s 3 promises

For the BJP, the UCC is the last of three promises that needs to be fulfilled — its goals of ending J&K’s special status under Article 370 and construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya have been attained. Party-ruled Uttarakhand’s UCC is to serve as a template for other states under the party until a nationwide law is enacted.
During his 98-minute address, the Prime Minister also underlined the need to realise the dream of “One nation, One election” – another BJP poll promise.
On the situation in Bangladesh, he said, “Whatever has happened in Bangladesh, as a neighbouring country, I can understand the concerns about it. I hope that the situation there will soon become normal. Especially, the concerns of 140 crore countrymen is that the safety of Hindus and minorities there should be ensured.”


“India always wants the neighbouring countries to walk on the path of happiness and peace. We have a commitment to peace, it is our culture. In the coming days, our good wishes will always be there in the development journey of Bangladesh because we are people who think about the welfare of mankind,” he said.
Referring to crimes against women, Modi said, “Today, I want to express my pain once again from the Red Fort. As a society, we have to think seriously about the country’s anger towards the atrocities being committed against our mothers, sisters and daughters. There is anger among the common people. I am feeling this anger.”
“The country, the society, our state governments have to take this seriously. Crimes against women should be investigated as soon as possible. Those who commit demonic acts should be given severe punishment as soon as possible. This is necessary to create trust in the society,” he said.
“I would also like to say that when incidents of rape and atrocities on women occur, it is discussed a lot, there is a lot of publicity, it gets covered in the media. But when a person with such a demonic mindset is punished, it is not seen anywhere in the news, it remains lying somewhere in a corner. Now the need of the hour is that there should be a wide discussion about the people who get punished so that even those who commit such sins fear that the consequence will be death by hanging… I feel it is very important to create this fear,” he said.

He also spoke about inducting “fresh blood” in politics. “We want to bring forward one lakh such youngsters as people’s representatives in the political life of the country as soon as possible. Initially, we want to bring forward one lakh such youngsters whose family members have no political background. Whose parents, siblings, uncles, maternal uncles and maternal aunts have never been in politics. One lakh such promising youngsters… whether they are in Panchayat, Nagar Palika, Zila Parishad, Vidhan Sabha or Lok Sabha,” he said.
He said that it is not necessary that one should join his party. They should go to the party of their choice, he said.
Referring to the successful hosting of the G20 Summit last year, Modi said, “It is India’s dream that the Olympics of 2036 be held on Indian soil. We are preparing for this and we are moving ahead for that.”
Stating that every citizen of the country has been troubled by the “termites of corruption”, he said, “Corruption at every level has broken the faith of the common man in the system… That is why I have launched a war against corruption on a large scale. I know I have to pay the price for this, my reputation has to pay the price. But my reputation cannot be bigger than the nation, my dreams cannot be bigger than the dreams of the nation. And that is why my fight against corruption will continue with honesty, it will continue at a rapid pace and action will definitely be taken against the corrupt.”
“I want to create an environment of fear for the corrupt so that I can stop the tradition of looting the common citizen of the country,” he said.

Speaking at an event in Mumbai organised to mark the 80th birth anniversary of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday, 20 August, contrasted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's minority government — which cannot function without the support of its allies, the JD(U) (Janata Dal–United) and the TDP (Telugu Desam Party), he said.

Congratulating his allies of the INDIA bloc, which has won 234 Lok Sabha seats, he described Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party as ""poison"" and maintained there was no need to taste it — in possibly a derisive nod at former allies (such as Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar) and members of the pre-split NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) and Shiv Sena who moved to ally with the BJP.

Kharge emphasised that the INDIA bloc has given a befitting reply to the BJP in the recent Lok Sabha polls, restricting its seat tally to 240, well below the majority mark of 272 and significantly less than the BJP's 303 tally of 2019.

The Congress chief asserted the BJP's political plans have been hit due to the growing number of parties joining the opposition bloc.

N Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Nitish Kumar-led JD(U), which won 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, respectively, are certainly providing crucial support to the BJP-led NDA government.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had his own anecdote about the Rajiv Gandhi regime to serve as contrast to the Modi dispensation.
Acknowledging that the undivided Shiv Sena and the Indian National Congress used to be bitter rivals in Rajiv Gandhi's time, Thackeray noted that they never acted with ""vindictiveness"" towards each other.
Speaking at the Sadbhavana Diwas event held to mark the 80th birth anniversary of the late former prime minister, whose tenure was cut short by his shocking assassination, Thackeray noted that central agencies never harassed Shiv Sena leaders even though party founder Bal Thackeray regularly and harshly criticised the then-prime minister in his speeches.

Uddhav Thackeray had joined hands with the Congress in 2019 after parting ways with the BJP, leading to a split in the party that saw the likes of Eknath Shinde — now chief minister of Maharashtra — rebel against the scion of Balasaheb Thackeray.

The programme was also attended by NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar, who saw a similar BJP-wards split in his party led by his own nephew Ajit Pawar.

Paying homage to Rajiv Gandhi, Thackeray said that despite having a brute majority of more than 400 seats in 1984, he brought in legislation that sought to strengthen the Panchayati Raj and decentralise power. The contrast, again, was obvious to followers of contemporary political events, with several non-BJP-led state governments striving to maintain their federal powers in opposition to the central government and the BJP's diktats, as well as their own governors.

""Sena chief Bal Thackeray harshly criticised Rajiv Gandhi but at no point I recall CBI, ED or Income Tax knocking on the doors of Shiv Sena leaders,"" Thackeray said, taking a veiled swipe at the BJP-led Union government.
While the incumbent prime minister was not named, the Opposition has had frequent occasion to accuse the Narendra Modi government of misusing the central investigation agencies against its political opponents. Thackeray did accuse the saffron party of resorting to ""power jihad"" however.

Thackeray also said that Rajiv Gandhi never shied away from tackling challenges and took on them boldly, referring to the steps the former prime minister took to soothe militancy in Punjab and north-east India.

""But (now the attitude is) let Manipur and Kashmir burn,"" he said, in another swipe at the NDA government.

The Opposition managed to reduce the BJP-led alliance's strength in the Lok Sabha in the general elections, but the ruling coalition has to be defeated decisively in the coming assembly elections in Maharashtra, he said.

The BJP accused him of abandoning Hindutva for the sake of aligning with the Congress, but the saffron party did not mind joining hands with JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu (who have different ideologies), Thackeray noted, pointing to the opportunism of the party and the alliance in power.

The rally seeks to highlight the “threat to democracy” after the arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren. The wives of both Kejriwal and Soren were also present at the rally and addressed it.

“We need to unite and only then will we be able to fight the BJP. We won’t succeed if we keep attacking and fighting each other,” Kharge said.
“This election is for saving democracy and the Constitution and we must fight unitedly,” he said.

Training his guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kharge said, “There is no level-playing field in this election. PM Modi has dug up the ground and is asking the opposition to play cricket there.” He said he told BJP chief J P Nadda at a recent meeting that this election is “not fair” as the Congress’ funds have already been “stolen”.
“The BJP and the RSS are like poison, don’t taste it. They have destroyed the country and they should not be allowed to destroy it further,” the Congress chief added.

Kharge said the country cannot prosper until Modi and his ideology are removed.
  
He also accused the prime minister of misusing institutions to threaten opposition parties and its leaders, and toppling their governments to form BJP governments.",,,,,,,

The BJP on Tuesday (August 20, 2024) appointed former party general secretary Ram Madhav as election in-charge for the coming Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir, a return to the State for him as he had handled the State in the past on behalf of the BJP and was instrumental in the BJP forming a coalition government there in 2015 along with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).


Mr. Madhav will be sharing the responsibility with Union Minister G. Kishen Reddy. Sources in the BJP told The Hindu that the appointment was discussed and approved “at the highest levels of the party”.

The BJP, which did not field candidates in the Kashmir Valley in the Lok Sabha polls, will be doing so in the Assembly polls, but more than that, Mr. Madhav’s appointment is a pointer to his relationships across the political aisle in Jammu and Kashmir. As one of the architects of the BJP-PDP alliance, which later broke off in some bitterness, his skills and connections will be required in any kind of post poll scenario that the mandate for the Assembly throws up.

 
The BJP’s catchment area for votes is mostly seen to be Hindu-dominated Jammu area, which has roughly 43 seats, with the Valley having 47 seats, in the 90-member Assembly under the new delimitation exercise. Senior BJP leaders have been emphasising that the party is not looking for any tie-ups with other parties, but party sources say, that “even if the BJP wins all seats in Jammu, it still has to speak across the aisle in any situation of forming the government.”

In 2015, the BJP got 25 seats, and the PDP won 28 seats in a House with 87 members. The alliance between the two parties came to power in March 2015, more than two months after the results for the Assembly were announced in December 2014, with a common minimum programme and with the late PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayed at the helm",https://zeenews.india.com/india/bjp-reignites-campaign-in-jammu-and-kashmir-ram-madhav-returns-to-lead-partys-first-post-article-370-election-push-2780945.html,BJP Reignites Campaign in Jammu and Kashmir: Ram Madhav Returns to Lead Party's First Post-Article 370 Election Push,"Ram Madhav, the strategic force behind the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) rise to power in Jammu & Kashmir through the 2015 coalition with the PDP, has returned to the forefront after nearly four years of relative inactivity.

BJP Reignites Campaign in Jammu and Kashmir: Ram Madhav Returns to Lead Party's First Post-Article 370 Election Push
With the Election Commission sounding the poll bugle for the Jammu and Kashmir elections, the political parties have intensified their public outreach. The BJP, which is facing its first big challenge in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, is looking to make inroads in the valley and maintain its winning streak in the Jammu region. Since the challenge is big this time, the party has deployed its trusted warhorse again this time. 

According to reports, Ram Madhav, the strategic force behind the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) rise to power in Jammu & Kashmir through the 2015 coalition with the PDP, has returned to the forefront after nearly four years of relative inactivity. Following a series of high-level meetings and discussions with the party's leadership, the BJP has named Madhav as co-in-charge of the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir elections, alongside G Kishan Reddy. This marks the first assembly election in the region since the revocation of Article 370.

Madhav, who held the position of general secretary (organisation) in the party for over five years, was removed from the role in 2020 before being reappointed to the RSS central committee in 2021. In addition to his work in Jammu & Kashmir, Madhav’s efforts in expanding the BJP’s presence in northeastern states have also garnered significant attention within the party.

Renowned as the BJP’s “firefighter” and a key figure in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s global outreach, including events like Madison Square and Howdy Modi in the United States, Madhav’s political career has been marked by “resilience and reinvention,” according to a senior RSS member who has closely collaborated with him.

In a significant political development, two major INDIA bloc parties — the Congress and the National Conference (NC) — have announced an alliance for the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.

The alliance, covering all 90 Assembly seats, was formalised after a high-level meeting between Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge and NC leader Farooq Abdullah at the latter's Gupkar Road residence in Srinagar.

The two parties had previously joined forces in the Lok Sabha elections as part of the INDIA bloc. However, the alliance faced setbacks, with Congress losing both seats in Jammu, and the NC losing one of the three seats it contested in the Kashmir valley.

NC president Farooq Abdullah confirmed that the paperwork would be finalised by tonight, and the Congress, NC, and CPI(M) would work together to contest the elections. He emphasised, ""We are hopeful that statehood will be returned. No doors are closed for anyone."" 

The Jammu and Kashmir elections, set to be held in three phases on 18 and 25 September and 1 October, with votes to be counted on 4 October, mark a crucial moment in the state's political history.

This will be the first election in the Union Territory since its statehood was revoked in August 2019. Media reported that Congress wants to contest 12 seats in the Kashmir valley, while offering 12 to NC in the Jammu division.


According to the Srinagar-based Kashmir.Com, Abdullah described the discussions on the alliance as “cordial” and expressed optimism about the alliance's potential to bring about meaningful change in Jammu and Kashmir.

The Congress posted a short video on X with the caption “united we stand,” showing Rahul Gandhi, Kharge, and Farooq and Omar Abdullah together, underscoring the unity between the two parties.

Dropping a significant hint that the alliance had been finalized, Congress Chief Mallikarjun Kharge shared a photograph of the meeting on X, featuring himself alongside Farooq Abdullah, Rahul Gandhi, and Omar Abdullah. The image, as per political watchers, underscores the unity among INDIA bloc parties as they prepare to contest the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.


Addressing the media earlier, Rahul Gandhi highlighted the significance of the alliance, stating, “When elections were announced in different states of the country, I met Kharge ji. Then we decided that we should first go to Jammu and Kashmir because we want to give a message to the people of the country that representation of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is most important for us. This is the first time in the history of India after independence that a state has been made a Union Territory.”

In the 2014 Assembly polls, which was also a four-way contest, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) emerged as the single-largest party with 28 seats (all in Kashmir) from a vote share of 23.85 per cent. The BJP finished as runner-up with 25 seats (all in Jammu) from a 26.23 per cent vote share.

Though both parties were poles apart ideologically, the PDP led by Mufti Mohd Sayeed decided to tie up with the BJP, with one thinking being that a government led by the two parties would be representative of both Jammu and Kashmir, and hence bridge the gap between the two sides.

The NC and the Congress, which had been allies until the elections, contested separately and won 15 and 12 seats, respectively. While the NC secured 21.14 per cent of the vote share, the Congress managed 18.36 per cent. Other parties, including the CPI(M) and Sajjad Lone's People’s Conference (PC), and Independents won the remaining seven seats.

The Congress-NC alliance, as per Kashmir watchers, in this elections is poised to reshape the political dynamics of Jammu and Kashmir, as both parties aim to restore the region's statehood and secure a strong mandate in the upcoming elections.",https://zeenews.india.com/india/farooq-abdullah-announces-alliance-with-congress-for-jk-assembly-elections-after-rahul-gandhis-visit-2781475.html,Farooq Abdullah Announces Alliance With Congress For J&K Assembly Elections After Rahul Gandhi's Visit,"Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi, accompanied by Congress President Malikarjun Kharge, visited Dr. Farooq Abdullah's residence in Srinagar before their departure to Jammu.

Emphasising his point, Gandhi displayed a picture of Lord Shiva, underscoring the deity’s teachings of fearlessness and non-violence. He further drew parallels with the core messages of other religions, including Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, to highlight the universal value of courage and fearlessness.Despite his explanations, the BJP benches erupted in protest. Home Minister Amit Shah demanded an apology from Gandhi, accusing him of offending millions of Hindus. Shah referenced historical events such as the Emergency and the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, asserting that the Congress party has no moral standing to speak on non-violence.“Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the House and the country for hurting the sentiments of crores of people who take pride in identifying themselves as Hindus,” Shah insisted.BJP leaders joined the chorus, with Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw calling Gandhi’s statement condemnable.Today Rahul Gandhi has called the entire Hindu society violent and untruthful. He has insulted the Hindu society and this is not the first time, this is the old method of Congress. In 2010, the then Home Minister P Chidambaram had called Hindus terrorists...

Calling Hindus violent, calling Hindus liars, putting up pictures of God during parliamentary debate, adding politics to it, this level of debate does not suit the leader of the opposition in any way, he remarked, as quoted by news agency ANI.BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla accused Gandhi of perpetuating ""Hindu hate,"" likening his remarks to past Congress references to “Hindu terror” and questioning the party’s stance on religious tolerance. Even after the elections, their Hindu hate continues unabated. They are the same ones who used terms like 'Hindu terror', 'saffron terror', Hindutva is like ISIS and Boko-Haram, who questioned the existence of Lord Ram... Now in the Temple of Democracy, they are saying that those who call themselves Hindus are violent and spreading hatred. Will they say about any other religion? On one hand, they say terrorism has no religion, but when it comes to Hindus, they keep abusing in the name of vote bank politics, he remarked.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also slammed the LoP, ""This is now the Leader of Opposition. Who attacks Hindus while professing brotherhood to all. Who disparages the Indian Army’s bravery, while expressing concern for their welfare. Who tears up Cabinet decisions, while preaching respect for Constitution. Welcome to the politics of the Congress Party.""On Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's speech in Parliament, Union Health Minister and BJP national president JP Nadda posted on X, ""First day, worst show! Lies + Hindu hatred = Rahul Gandhi Ji in Parliament. Third Time Fail LoP has a knack for agitated, flawed logic. His speech today has shown that neither has he understood the mandate of 2024 (his third successive loss) nor does he have any humility."" BJP MP Arun Govil criticised Gandhi, stating, ""He should apologise to all Hindus... He tried to create drama today but he does not know how to do that. For drama, understanding the content is important. He has not grown up. He is still immature.""",,,Rahul Gandhi's Remarks Spark Controversy in Parliament,"
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's speech in the Lok Sabha on Monday ignited a heated debate, drawing strong reactions from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gandhi, recently appointed as the Leader of Opposition, made controversial statements about Hinduism and the BJP that led to vehement protests from the treasury benches.
During his address, Gandhi asserted that those who call themselves Hindus but perpetuate violence and hatred do not represent the entire Hindu community. He clarified that his remarks were specifically directed at the BJP and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), stating, ""The BJP, the RSS, or Modi are not the entire Hindu society.""
To illustrate his point, Gandhi displayed a picture of Lord Shiva, emphasizing the deity's teachings of fearlessness and non-violence. He drew parallels with core messages from other religions to highlight universal values of courage and fearlessness.
The BJP leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, strongly objected to Gandhi's comments. Modi called it a ""grave accusation against the entire Hindu community,"" while Shah demanded an apology, accusing Gandhi of offending millions of Hindus.
Several BJP leaders joined in criticizing Gandhi's remarks. Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw called the statement condemnable, and BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused Gandhi of perpetuating ""Hindu hate.""
The Congress party defended Gandhi's speech, arguing that his comments were specifically aimed at the BJP and RSS, not the entire Hindu community. They emphasized Gandhi's attempt to distinguish between the teachings of Hinduism and the actions of certain political entities.
The incident has reignited debates about religious rhetoric in Indian politics and the interpretation of religious identity in the political sphere. As the controversy continues to unfold, it highlights the sensitive nature of religious discourse in India's political landscape.
This event marks a contentious start to Gandhi's tenure as Leader of Opposition, setting the tone for what may be a combative parliamentary session ahead.",,,
https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/bjp-seeks-date-change-for-haryana-polls-congress-aap-say-party-sensing-defeat,"BJP seeks date change for Haryana polls; Congress, AAP say party sensing defeat","The Haryana unit of the ruling BJP has written to the Election Commission requesting a brief postponement of the Assembly poll slated for 1 October, citing holidays before and after the election date that could lead to a lower voter turnout.

While the opposition Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) slammed the BJP, claiming that the ruling party was panicking as it could sense defeat, Abhay Chautala's INLD too sought the deferment of polls.

A Haryana BJP leader on Saturday said the letter was sent by the party's state unit chief Mohan Lal Badoli to the poll panel.

Haryana's chief electoral officer Pankaj Agarwal confirmed that the commission received a copy of the communication on Friday over email.

""We have received the communication from state BJP and forwarded it to the Election Commission,"" Agarwal told PTI.

Varinder Garg, a member of the BJP's state election management committee, said, ""We have reasoned that the Assembly election date of 1 October (Tuesday) is preceded by a weekend and followed by more holidays which might hit the voting percentage as people tend to go on vacation on long weekends.""

Garg said 28-29 September are Saturday and Sunday while 1 October is a poll holiday. It is followed by more holidays as Gandhi Jayanti falls on 2 October and Maharaja Agrasen Jayanti on 3 October, he said.

""We have written to the Election Commission in this regard. For a better turnout, any new date once the string of holidays is over should be fine,"" Garg told PTI over the phone.
By taking a day's leave on 30 September, people will have six holidays. Due to this long weekend, there is a strong possibility that several families might go on a vacation and give voting a miss, Badoli said in his letter to the EC.

If it happens, the voting percentage would reduce drastically, he added.

Badoli also said that on 'Asoj Amavasya' on 2 October, several members of the Bishnoi community of Haryana will leave for Nokha tehsil of Bikaner in Rajasthan to participate in an annual fair held on the occasion.

This too can affect the voting percentage, he further said.

Badoli wrote that it has been the continuous effort of the EC to ensure that the maximum number of people exercise their franchise to strengthen democracy.

Therefore, it would be appropriate that the date fixed for voting for the Haryana Assembly election be changed. While determining a fresh date for the election, it should be made certain that there is no holiday the previous or the following day, he wrote.

We believe that if the EC does this, more and more voters will be able to participate in the election, he wrote.

Badoli, in his letter, also mentioned that in the past the date of polling has been changed by the EC. For example, the date declared for voting in Punjab Assembly elections -- 14 February 2022 -- was changed to 20 February 2022, due to Sant Ravidas Jayanti on 16 February.

In 2022, the then Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the BJP and its allies, and the BSP had urged the poll panel to postpone the date of voting as lakhs of followers of Guru Ravidas travel to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to celebrate the day.

However, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the BJP's stand shows that it has already accepted defeat.

It has been more than a week since the Election Commission announced the poll date. The BJP wants the polls to be deferred as it has accepted defeat, Bhupinder Hooda, who is Leader of the Opposition and former chief minister of Haryana, said.

Polls should be held according to the date fixed by the EC... People of Haryana don't want to see the BJP government in power even for a day, he said.",https://www.opindia.com/2024/08/there-is-no-alliance-in-state-capable-congress-snubs-aap-rules-out-alliance-in-haryana/,"‘There is no alliance in the state; we are capable’: Congress snubs AAP, rules out alliance in Haryana","As Haryana gears up for the assembly elections, Congress leader and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday dismissed all claims of forming an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the state, stating that Congress is capable of contesting the elections on its own. Regarding an alliance with AAP, Hooda said, “We have an alliance with the Samajwadi Party too, but it is a central-level alliance, not state-based. We have no alliance here in Haryana. We have an alliance with all parties at the national level, but there are no such discussions at the state level. Congress is fully capable of contesting the elections alone.” Hooda further remarked that in the upcoming elections, the primary competition is between Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leaving no space for ‘vote cutters’. Commenting on the INLD-BSP alliance for the forthcoming elections, Hooda stated, “The Lok Sabha results have clearly shown that the competition is between Congress and the BJP, with no room for vote cutters.” Hooda also clarified that he is not retired and will contest the upcoming elections in the state. Addressing the issue of the Chief Ministerial candidate for the upcoming Haryana Assembly elections and his statement, “Neither tired nor retired,” Hooda reiterated, “There is no such thing as tired or retired. I had said that I would contest the election this time. I am neither tired nor retired.” Referring to the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, Hooda pointed out that there has been a decrease in the BJP’s vote percentage and an increase in Congress’s vote share, indicating that people are inclined to form a Congress government in the state. On the upcoming Haryana Assembly elections, Hooda said, “In the Lok Sabha elections, people have given clear indications that the 36 fraternities of Haryana have decided that the next government will be formed by the Congress party. We received the highest vote share of the INDIA Alliance across India. There are 10 parliamentary constituencies here, and all 10 of them registered a drop in the BJP’s vote share while Congress saw a rise. Similarly, across the 90 Assembly constituencies, Congress’s vote share has increased, while the BJP’s has declined. This is a clear indication. Based on the public support we are receiving through our various campaigns, whether it’s ‘Hisaab Maange Haryana’ or ‘Ghar-Ghar Congress,’ I can confidently say that the people have made up their minds to form a Congress government.” On the topic of potential factionalism within the party, Hooda dismissed such concerns, saying, “There is no factionalism in the party. All party leaders are united and working to strengthen Congress. If you want to see factionalism, look at the BJP; you might notice it among leaders like Anil Vij, Ram Vilas Sharma, or Rao Inderjit Singh.” The elections for Haryana’s 90 assembly constituencies will be held in a single phase on October 1, with the counting of votes scheduled for October 4. Haryana has a total of 2.01 crore voters, of which 1.06 crore are males, 0.95 crore are females, 4.52 lakh are first-time voters, and 40.95 lakh are young voters. The last date to file nominations in Haryana is September 12, with scrutiny taking place on September 13. The final date for the withdrawal of candidatures is September 16. The current government’s term in Haryana will end on November 3, 2024, with elections to be held in all 90 legislative assembly constituencies. In the 2019 elections, the BJP, with 40 seats in the 90-member assembly, formed a coalition government with the JJP, which had won 10 seats, while the Congress had secured 31 seats. Earlier this year, the BJP-JJP alliance was dissolved. In 2024, Haryana is likely to witness a four-way contest between the BJP, Congress, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and AAP.",,,,,,,
https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/after-fertiliser-and-flood-jihad-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarmas-muslim-marriage-jihad,"After ‘fertiliser’ and ‘flood’ jihad, Assam CM’s ‘Muslim marriage’ jihad","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who has blamed Muslims for ‘fertiliser jihad’ and ‘flood jihad’ in recent weeks, is all set to present a Bill that will make registration of marriage and divorce among Muslims compulsory in the state.

Claiming that the objective of the Bill was to prevent child marriage, the chief minister told the media in Guwahati, ""earlier, Muslim marriages and divorces were conducted by qazis. This new Bill will ensure that the government and not qazis register and validate marriages and divorce among Muslims"". Earlier this year, the government had repealed the Assam Moslem Marriages and Divorces Registration Act of 1935 through an ordinance.

All marriages among Muslims, but not Hindus or other communities, were to follow the Special Marriage Act. This was said to be the first step towards a uniform civil code (UCC).

Under the 1935 Act, 94 Muslim registrars were functioning in the state until February 2024 as government employees. Assam minister Jayanta Mallabarua had stated then that the registration of Muslim marriages and divorces would be taken up by the district commissioner and district registrar. He had also announced that the 94 Muslim registrars, who were functioning under the Act, would be discharged from their duties with a one-time compensation of Rs 2 lakh each.

This week’s move to have another law caught everyone by surprise, not least because child marriage is not confined to the Muslim community, if that is indeed the objective now and not a UCC. In fact, more child marriages are recorded among Hindus than Muslims.
At a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been busy promoting the idea of a ‘secular’ and uniform code and the BJP is all for a UCC, Assam’s haste in rushing through a separate law looks to be in defiance of both the party and the prime minister. There is no explanation yet on why other communities, and especially the Hindus who constitute the majority, are exempt.

It is not known if there is immediate provocation or urgency, and most observers in the state seem to believe that it looks like one more diversionary tactic designed to polarise the people at the same time. Observers also wondered if, as and when a similar ‘uniform’ law is enacted for Hindus and other communities, can the state keep priests and religious leaders out of marriages?

Others believe that the implications do not seem to have been thought through by the Assam cabinet. Will the availability of the registrar and the sub-registrar on a particular day or week now determine the wedding dates, they asked, asking in addition if the registrars would move from one home to other registering marriages. Mandatory registration for everyone within a month of the community wedding, they point out, would have served the same purpose.

In 2023, the Assam chief minister had accused Bengali Muslim vegetable growers of the state of “fertiliser jihad” and blamed the farmers for conspiring to damage Hindu buyers’ health by allegedly using an overdose of chemicals in the crops, ignoring the obvious fact that the vegetables were being consumed by both Muslims and Hindus. The state government was also working on introducing a new law that would criminalise 'love jihad' and award life imprisonment to those found guilty.
Himanta Biswa Sarma has also ramped up what he now calls ‘flood jihad’ allegedly being conducted by the University of Science and Technology (USTM) in Meghalaya. The university last week became the only private university in the Northeast to be included in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, released by the Union ministry of education.

Sarma, however, has accused USTM of being responsible for flooding Guwahati in August following heavy rains on 5 August and a sharp shower on 20 August. Sarma also accused the university of deliberately constructing its gates to resemble Mecca. His government, Sarma threatened, would move the NGT (National Green Tribunal) against the university.

There are few takers for the chief minister’s delusional takes. Most Guwahati residents blame reckless construction, concretisation of Guwahati and encroachments filling up the ponds, streams and wetlands for flooding the city. They also point out that USTM, a private university established in 2008, is located in the 9th Mile area in Ri-Bhoi district of Meghalaya near Assam’s Jorabat, the entry point to Guwahati.

The capital city itself is a trough surrounded by as many as 15 hills, most of them within Assam. While vegetation on the hills have suffered owing to construction activities, leading to more rainwater flowing into the city, blaming one university on one of the hills for flooding is not credible, they say.

There were discussions on trade, economic issues, defence, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, education, he said. Modi and Zelenskyy also tasked the India-Ukraine inter-governmental commission to specifically focus on rebuilding trade and economic relations.

",,,Indian Prime Minister Visits Ukraine Amid Ongoing Conflict,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kyiv today, marking the first visit by an Indian leader to Ukraine since the establishment of bilateral relations in 1992. The visit comes at a critical juncture, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine enters its third year.
Modi's trip to Ukraine follows his recent visit to Russia, where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin. The back-to-back diplomatic engagements highlight India's efforts to maintain balanced relations with both nations involved in the conflict.
During his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Modi emphasized the importance of peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy. The two leaders engaged in extensive discussions covering various aspects of the ongoing conflict, including its impact on global food and energy security.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar described the talks as ""detailed, open, and constructive,"" noting that both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to upholding principles of international law, such as respect for territorial integrity and state sovereignty.
The visit also focused on strengthening bilateral relations between India and Ukraine. Discussions covered areas such as trade, economics, defense, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and education. Both leaders agreed to task the India-Ukraine inter-governmental commission with rebuilding trade and economic relations.
Ukraine welcomed India's potential involvement in future peace initiatives, including the possibility of Indian participation in the next Peace Summit. The two sides also explored the prospect of Indian companies contributing to Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.
The international community has shown interest in Modi's diplomatic efforts. The United States described the visit as ""potentially helpful"" if it can contribute to ending the conflict in a manner aligned with President Zelenskyy's vision for a just peace.
As the conflict continues, India maintains its stance that this is ""not the era of war"" and advocates for a peaceful solution. While India has historically maintained close ties with Russia, it has also called for an immediate cessation of hostilities at the United Nations.
Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine underscores India's commitment to playing a constructive role in seeking a resolution to the ongoing conflict while balancing its relationships with both Russia and Ukraine.",,,
https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/further-strengthens-my-point-rahul-gandhi-slams-bjprss-over-attack-on-gujarat-party-office,"Further strengthens my point: Rahul to BJP, RSS after attack on party office","A day after activists from the VHP and Bajrang Dal reportedly attacked the Congress office in Ahmedabad, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi stated that the incident only confirmed his assertion that the Sangh Parivar is engaged in politics of violence.

Holding the BJP and RSS responsible for the attack on the Gujarat Congress office in Ahmedabad, Gandhi posted on X: ""The cowardly and violent attack on the Gujarat Congress office further strengthens my point about the BJP and the Sangh Parivar.

""The people of Gujarat can clearly see through their lies and will teach the BJP government a decisive lesson,"" Gandhi added. ""I repeat — INDIA is going to win in Gujarat!""
Gandhi's remarks follow a clash between BJP and Congress workers, who reportedly ran into each other outside the Congress headquarters. The confrontation occurred during a protest against Gandhi's allegedly ""anti-Hindu"" remarks in the Lok Sabha on Monday, 1 July.

While the Congress accused BJP cadre for initiating the violence, the BJP claimed Congress workers attacked a ""peaceful protest"".
NH has reported that on 2 July, individuals associated with the BJP, Bajrang Dal and VHP hurled stones at the office in protest against Gandhi's comments in his Lok Sabha speech.

The right-wing activists also defaced posters and photos of Gandhi with black ink and allegedly beat up the security guard at the office, as well as manhandling his wife and daughter, who were present on the premises.
Gujarat has long been a stronghold for the BJP, which has not lost an election there since 2002. In 2022, the BJP secured a record-breaking supermajority in the Assembly elections, winning 156 of 182 legislative council seats — the most ever won by any party in Gujarat's history. In contrast, the Congress experienced its lowest seat count in three decades, winning only 17 seats. The Aam Aadmi Party made some inroads, gaining five seats.

After PM Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah sought Rahul Gandhi's apology on the issue. Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states also sharpened their attacks on Rahul Gandhi.Hindu is the basic soul of India. Hindu is synonymous with tolerance, generosity and gratitude.

After a decade in power he is omnipresent - but frequently seen at his side is a less talked-about politician, who has helped mastermind the extraordinary rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Amit Shah - often called India's ""second most powerful man"" - is a formidable old friend, Mr Modi's closest confidant and the brains behind his election juggernaut. A hardline Hindu nationalist popularly known as Amitbhai, Mr Shah has charted numerous election wins for the BJP. He lacks the star power of the PM and is a more private man. But he is an excellent organiser and campaign strategist, a shrewd politician - and like Mr Modi, a hugely polarising figure. His supporters view him as the ""great defender of the Hindu faith"" but those who dare cross him find a feared adversary. Critics say he is the driving force behind some of India's most controversial legislation, including scrapping Kashmir's partial autonomy - which had been a BJP manifesto pledge for decades - and a new citizenship law that has been described as deeply discriminatory towards Muslims",https://www.opindia.com/2024/03/modi-will-remain-pm-for-the-next-10-years-home-minister-amit-shah-at-republic-summit/,‘Modiji will remain India’s PM for the next 10 years’: Home Minister Amit Shah at Republic Summit 2024,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah while speaking at the Republic TV Summit 2024 on Thursday emphasised the good work put in by the government in the last 10 years and said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will continue to govern for the next ten years.Asked about the political outlook for the next ten years Home Minister Amit said, “There is a dynamic democracy in our country which evaluates performances and gives its mandate depending on that. The mood and mandate in the past used to be based on caste, creed and religion and on the basis of appeasement. Now PM Modi has established politics of performance. Performance will determine who stays in power, the country will give an opportunity to those who perform. If we perform well, we will stay in power, if we do not control our drawbacks then we will not win. Because you have asked about the next 10 years, I can tell you that for the next 10 years it will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi only.” The Home Minister also hit out at RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav for raising question on the absence of the Prime Minister’s family “Modi ji has worked only and only for the people of the country for 40 years. Even after being Chief Minister and Prime Minister for 23 years, I have not seen him taking leave. I have seen PM Modi working diligently from 5 am in the morning to 1 am in the night. And it is a result of that there is such a large cadre with him” the Home Minister added. Amit Shah further said there has never been any allegations of corruption against PM Modi. “In a democracy, the people of the country answer every question raised against the government. Leaders who scammed the citizens are now absconding. In 23 years of Modi ji’s tenure, first as the Chief Minister and then as the Prime Minister, there has not been a single allegation against him. Even the opposition cannot blame Modi ji for anything, such is the transparency with which he works” Amit Shah said “We have had our government at the centre for 10 years. But even our opponents cannot blame Modi ji for even 4 annas worth of corruption. We have governed with transparency,” Amit Shah added. “People who are trying to lower the level of country’s politics by talking nonsense, the public is giving them a befitting reply each time. I have seen Modi ji very closely, have worked with him for a long time. In a sense, Lalu ji has rightly said that Modi ji has no family.

People did not sacrifice their lives for an India which is poor, unsafe or does not have a standing in the world. People were martyred for the dream of a strong and prosperous India. That dream was, is, and will remain our mission and vision for India” he said. The Home Minister emphasised that in 2047, India would transform into a developed nation. He also reiterated that the Citizenship Amendment Act will be implemented before the Lok Sabha elections. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 was passed by the Parliament in December 2019. The Union Home Minister said, “This will be implemented before the elections…this is the law of the country, no one can stop it, this is set in stone, this is the reality.” Shah also batted for the Uniform Civil Code saying that this is not only the agenda of the BJP, but also the vision of constitutional assembly and included in Article 44 of the constitution. “Unfortunately, UCC has been associated with religion.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68498675,Invisible in our own country': Being Muslim in Modi's India,"Six years ago, a Muslim boy returned red-faced from a well-known school in the northern Indian city of Agra.""My classmates called me a Pakistani terrorist,"" the nine-year-old told his mother. Reema Ahmad, an author and counsellor, remembers the day vividly. ""Here was a feisty, little boy with his fists clenched so tightly that there were nail marks in his palm. He was so angry."" As her son told the story, his classmates were having a mock fight when the teacher had stepped out. ""That's when one group of boys pointed at him and said, 'This is a Pakistani terrorist. Kill him!'"" He revealed some classmates had also called him nali ka kida (insect of the gutter). Ms Ahmad complained, and was told they ""were imagining things… such things didn't happen"". Ms Ahmad eventually pulled her son out of school. Today, the 16-year-old is home-schooled. ""I sensed the community's tremors through my son's experiences, a feeling I never recall having in my own youth growing up here,"" she says. ""Our class privilege may have protected us from feeling Muslim all the time. Now, it seems class and privilege make you a more visible target."" Ever since Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in 2014, India's 200 million-odd Muslims have had a turbulent journey. Hindu vigilante mobs have lynched suspected cow traders and targeted small Muslim-owned businesses. Petitions have been filed against mosques. Internet trolls have orchestrated online ""auctions"" of Muslim women. Right-wing groups and sections of mainstream media have fuelled Islamophobia with accusations of ""jihad"" - ""love jihad"", for example, falsely accuses Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage. And anti-Muslim hate speech has surged - three quarters of incidents were reported from states ruled by the BJP. ""Muslims have become second-class citizens, an invisible minority in their own country,"" says Ziya Us Salam, author of a new book, Being Muslim in Hindu India. But the BJP - and Mr Modi - deny that minorities are being mistreated in India. ""These are usual tropes of some people who don't bother to meet people outside their bubbles. Even India's minorities don't buy this narrative anymore,"" the prime minister told Newsweek magazine. Yet Ms Ahmad - whose family has lived in Agra for decades, counting many Hindu friends amid the city's serpentine lanes and crowded homes - feels a change. In 2019, Ms Ahmad left a school WhatsApp group where she was one of only two Muslims. This followed the posting of a message after India launched air strikes against militants in Muslim-majority Pakistan. ""If they hit us with missiles, we will enter their homes and kill them,"" the message on the group said, echoing something Mr Modi had said about killing terrorists and enemies of India inside their homes. ""I lost my cool. I told my friends what's wrong with you? Do you condone killing of civilians and children?"" Ms Ahmad recalled. She believed in advocating for peace. The reaction was swift. ""Someone asked, are you pro-Pakistani just because you are Muslim? They accused me of being anti-national,"" she said. ""Suddenly appealing for non-violence was equated with being anti-national. I told them I don't have to be violent to support my country. I quit the group."" The changing atmosphere is felt in other ways too. For a long time, Ms Ahmad's spacious home has been a hangout for her son's classmates, regardless of gender or religion. But now the bogey of ""love jihad"" means she asks Hindu girls to leave by a certain hour and not linger in his room. ""My father and I sat my son down and told him that the atmosphere was not good - you have to limit your friendships, be careful, not stay out too late. You never know. Things can turn into 'love jihad' at any time."" Environmental activist Erum, a fifth-generation resident of Agra, has also noticed a shift in conversations among the city's children as she worked in local schools. ""I am thinking, really?! This reflects the deeply ingrained phobia [of Muslims]. This will grow into something which will not heal easily,"" Ms Erum said. So what about the future of India's Muslims - also divided on class, sect, caste and regional lines - in the world's most populous country? Mr Salam talks about a sense of ""lingering fear"". ""People talk about lack of jobs and inflation for Muslim community. But it's just not about inflation and employment. It is about right to life."" Recent memoirs by young Muslims speak of similar fears. ""Almost everyone has picked a country where they would run to when the inevitable happens. Some have got in touch with uncles settled in Canada, the US, Turkey or the UK, if they ever need asylum. Even someone like me, who felt safe even in times of communal violence, now worries about my family's future in my homeland,"" writes Zeyad Masroor Khan in his recent book City on Fire: A Boyhood in Aligarh. In Agra, Ms Ahmad also feels the weight of uncertainty about the future. ""In the beginning I thought it [Muslim-baiting] was fringe and it would pass. That was 10 years ago. Now I feel a lot has been permanently lost and damaged."" But for herself, she had lots of Hindu friends, and did not feel insecure as a Muslim woman. It's just not about the children. In his small office along a bustling Agra street, Siraj Qureshi, a local journalist and interfaith organiser, laments the fraying of the old bonhomie between Hindus and Muslims. He recounts a recent incident where a man delivering mutton in the city was stopped by Hindu right-wing group members, handed over to the police and thrown into jail. ""He had the proper licence, but the police still arrested him. He was later released,"" Mr Qureshi says. Many in the community note a shift in behaviour among Muslims traveling by train, prompted by incidents in which Muslim passengers were reportedly attacked for allegedly carrying beef. ""Now, we're all cautious, avoiding non-vegetarian food in public transport or opting out [of public transport] altogether if we can afford to,"" says Ms Ahmad. ""Don't talk to me, my mother has told me not to,"" she heard one child tell a Muslim classmate.",https://www.opindia.com/2024/04/pm-modi-muslims-infiltrators-altnews-mohammad-zubair-pakistan-hamir-mir-spread-fake-news/,"Did PM Modi brand all Muslims as ‘infiltrators’? How Islamists including AltNews’ Mohammad Zubair, Pakistanis and ‘liberals’ spread fake news","On Sunday (21st April), Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on the Congress party for including the ultra-leftist agenda of ‘Wealth redistribution’ promised by Rahul Gandhi. PM Modi asserted that its election manifesto reflects the ideology of Maoists. While addressing an election rally in Banswara, Rajasthan, PM Modi spoke about Rahul Gandhi’s promise that the nation’s wealth would be surveyed and redistributed. Talking about the speech by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where he had claimed that Muslims should have the first right to the nation’s resources, PM Modi said that if Congress comes back to power, they will redistribute the nation’s wealth among Muslims, intruders and those who have multiple children. The speech by the Prime Minister sent Congress, Islamists, Leftists and their media allies into a tizzy. Almost as soon as PM Modi delivered the speech, a flurry of lies was unleashed to claim that the Prime Minister branded all Muslims as ‘Ghuspethiyas’ or ‘intruders’ in India. Maktoob Media, which has a history of spreading hate against Hindus and whitewashing the crimes of Islamists, published a report claiming that the speech by PM Modi was “Islamophobic” since it branded all Muslims as infiltrators and ‘those who have more children’. While Islamists and so-called fact-checkers claimed that all Muslims were called infiltrators when one hears the speech by PM Modi, it becomes evident that he differentiated between Muslims and infiltrators, while saying that Congress will redistribute wealth to both these sections. PM Modi emphasised, “They have said that if they form a government then a survey of property belonging to every person will be done. It will be checked how much gold our sisters own, how much money government employees have…They also said that gold owned by our sisters would be equally distributed. Does govt have the right to take your property? ‘Mangalsutra’ sone ki keemat ka mudda nahi hai, unke sapno se juda hua hai…” Highlighting the same, the Prime Minister added that this means that after doing the wealth survey they will distribute it to people who have more children, to illegal migrants, and to Muslims, for whom Manmohan Singh had said they had the first right over resources. Now, each of these elements needs to be looked at separately. When the Prime Minister spoke about ‘those with more children’, we must recall that Rahul Gandhi and Congress have been harping on ‘jitni abadi utna haq’, claiming that wealth should be redistributed according to population share. It therefore becomes obvious that those with more children would get a greater share of the redistributed wealth. That Muslims have more children compared to Hindus or any other segment of society is a fact that cannot be denied simply because the truth is deemed Islamophobic by Islamists. Next, the PM says that Muslims would get a larger share of this ‘redistributed wealth’. Going by the statements of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress’ propensity to appease Muslims, this statement also cannot be negated. The Congress can defend itself as they deem fit, however, it is also true that so far in the speech, PM Modi has not branded all Muslims as infiltrators. It is only after this statement and after a pause, that PM Modi mentioned infiltrators (ghuspethiyas). Which was a clear indication towards illegal migrants such as Rohingyas and Bangladeshis who have illegally squatted in India, and those who Congress appeases regularly. These are three distinct segments mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech, and claiming that he called all Indian Muslims as ‘infiltrators’ is a gross misrepresentation of his speech.",,,,,,,

NDTV Explains | 15 Years After Split, Naveen Patnaik's BJD Hints At NDA Return In the past, support from the BJD and ex-Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy - his YSR Congress was ousted by the BJP's ally, Chandrababu Naidu's TDP - was crucial on several occasions, such as the election of Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to the Rajya Sabha in 2009 and 2014. More recently, the BJD's support also helped the BJP push through the Delhi services bill, ensured a no-confidence motion against the Modi government flopped, and pushed through laws like Triple Talaq and the J&K Reorganisation Bill.

The party also flagged social and economic issues, including the controversial topic of MSP, or minimum support price, for farmers, which has been a bone of contention between the opposition and the BJP since the violent protests of 2021/22. The BJD also said it will ""demand inclusion of 162 communities"" in the state's Scheduled Tribes list, which it said it had been lobbying for ""for many years"". All of this comes after thumping wins by Mr Modi's party in the May-June Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. In the former the BJP routed the BJD by winning 20 of the state's 21 seats and, in the latter, Mr Patnaik - who lost the Kantabanji seat to the BJP's Laxman Bag - won only 51 of 147, down from 112 five years ago.

According to the Election Commission of India’s website, the BJP is becoming the single largest party in the state. It is leading on 76 seats including in Bargarh, Kalahandi, Balangir, Puri, Sambalpur, and Keonjhar constituencies. Notably, 74 is the coveted halfway mark in the state assembly which has a total strength of 147 seats. Naveen Patnaik-led BJD is ahead on 53 seats while Congress is leading on 13 seats. If the numbers hold, Odisha may get its first BJP Chief Minister in the state’s history. The BJP had fought the elections on the issue of Odisha Asmita asserting that while the BJD is being run from backdoors by a Tamil-born IAS turned politician, it will make an Odia-born person the Chief Minister of the state. While BJP is very likely to form the government in Odisha, it is not clear who will be the Chief Minister. The party didn’t project a CM candidate before the elections. Additionally, if the trends don’t reverse it will transform state politics, ushering in a post-Naveen era, which has been the buzz among political circles. Naveen Patnaik has been the Chief Minister of Odisha since March 2000. Had he won this time, he would have become the country’s longest-serving Chief Minister in August, surpassing Sikkim’s ex-CM Pawan Chamling. Although facing anti-incumbency in his own constituency regions due to ‘Dadan Khati‘ and concerns about his alleged deteriorating health, he is leading in both the constituencies he contested, Kantabanji and Hinjli, but by narrow margins, less then 5000 votes. During the campaigning, the BJP had launched scathing attacks on the BJD government over the issue of Odia Asmita (pride). It asserted that an Odisha-born person should be the Chief Minister of the state rather than a Tamil-born retired IAS officer running the government without accountability. According to the BJP, BJD was running a proxy government in the name of Naveen Patnaik and Tamil-born bureaucrat turned BJD leader VK Pandian was functioning as the ‘de-facto’ CM who was controlling and dictating terms to 77-year-old Patnaik whose health is allegedly deteriorating. From an election rally on 29th May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concerns about the deteriorating health of BJD Chief, Naveen Patnaik. The development came a day after a video of CM Patnaik went viral in which his alleged proxy, VK Pandian, was seen grabbing his shaking hands to hide them from the public. PM Modi stressed that people who are close to CM Patnaik have expressed concerns about how his health has deteriorated drastically in the last year. He added that it has led many of them to suspect that there could be a conspiracy behind it. PM Modi announced that after forming the government in the state, the saffron party will form a special committee to probe whether the lobby that is running state in Patnaik’s name is responsible for his poor health. Furthermore, Lok Sabha and state assembly elections were held simultaneously in Odisha, the state had given a split verdict in the previous election. Contrastingly, the state has voted decisively in favour of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections. As per ECI trends, the BJP is leading on 19 seats out of 21 Lok Sabha seats.",,,,,,,

https://thewire.in/politics/modi-kejriwal-aap-excise-policy-case,Modi's Crusade Against Kejriwal Shows He Has Forgotten – and Learnt – Nothing,"Prime Minister Modi’s empty boast “abki baar 400 paar (this time, beyond 400 seats)” is now one that the Bharatiya Janata Party would dearly like to forget, for the party’s strength has been reduced from 303 seats in 2019 to 240 this year, making it wholly dependent now upon the continued support of two major regional parties that neither share his totalitarian goals, nor his Messianic image of himself. This is the first time in 22 years as chief minister of Gujarat and then as prime minister of India, that Modi has found himself not in a position of untrammelled power. The question that lurks in every mind today is, will he be able to adjust his so far tyrannical style of governance to a situation he has never been in before? Nothing he has ever said or done, either as the chief minister of Gujarat or prime minister of India, suggests that he will be able to do so. This is because his single, consistent response to any political setback throughout these years has been rage. Over the past 22 years he has turned this rage upon all those who have tried to thwart his ambitions. Beginning with former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya in 2001, and ending most recently with Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, human rights lawyer Teesta Setalvad and former Gujarat Intelligence chief R.B. Sreekumar, Modi has used one or other of the government’s law enforcement agencies to terrorise his political opponents. Today, Modi is venting his rage upon the Aam Aadmi party, and most viciously upon its founder, Arvind Kejriwal. Modi’s rage against Kejriwal in particular, arises from the BJP’s rout in the 2015 Delhi state elections, barely a year after it had won all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, in 2014. Despite the BJP’s having repeated this success both in 2019 and 2024, Modi’s rage against AAP, and against Kejriwal in particular, remains unabated. In the nine years that have elapsed since then, Modi has stopped at nothing in his bid to discredit the Delhi state government and force it out of power in the national capital. When the Kejriwal government changed the state’s liquor licensing policy in 2021, he got the opportunity that he had been looking for. There are only two possible answers – either Naresh Kumar’s letter was a fabrication dictated by the Modi government, or the ED felt that the information it contained was insufficient and imprecise, and needed to be reinforced with more direct evidence. Of these, the first is by far the more plausible explanation. This is for the simple reason that the new liquor policy not only did not cause a loss of excise duty revenues, but actually doubled them. I have explained this point in an earlier article but the details are worth repeating. Under the earlier policy, the Delhi government was both the wholesaler and the retailer of alcohol in the city. The government paid the manufacturer their ex-factory price plus 5%, took control of the liquor and bore the cost of transportation and storage till it was supplied to the retail outlets. The retail outlets were also all controlled by the government, but licensed from the premise owners. This bureaucratic monopoly had a number of shortcomings: first, the number of brands of any particular spirit stocked by the government liquor shops was limited and not responsive to changes in public tastes and incomes; and second, the retail liquor shops were concentrated mainly in the high income neighbourhoods of Delhi. There were very few in the poorer areas of the city. Over the years this policy had led to a serious loss of revenue to the government. High income earners began buying their liquor in Haryana. Because of the lack of shops near them, the poor were buying country liquor. AAP’s new policy corrected these distortions while simultaneously taking the government out of the liquor business altogether. The wholesalers paid a one-time tax of 14% on their sales in Delhi. The retail outlets were reorganised to ensure that there was an even distribution of these throughout the city. The government had divided the city into 32 zones, of which 20 were classified as affluent, and the remaining 12 as relatively poor. Each zone was divided into a number of principalities, each to be served by up to three retail locations. The retail locations were evenly spaced to ensure that every mohalla, and every section of the population, had equal access to a liquor shop. It then auctioned the liquor shop locations. These were then put up for auction. In the first auction, the government garnered Rs 5,300 crore from the auction of locations in the more affluent 20 zones, and Rs 3,180 crore from the auctions in the remaining 12 zones. The lower paying capacity of the poorer areas was automatically reflected in the lower bids for these locations. An important side benefit of the new policy was that by giving easier access to licensed liquor in poor areas, it reduced the sale of illicit liquor within those areas. Two months after the new policy came into operation, a civil servant, who withheld his name while sharing the above figures to Hindustan Times, told its correspondent that along with new brand licensing and some other minor taxes, the government expected to garner over Rs 10,000 crore a year from the sale of liquor in the capital. This was almost double the average of Rs 5,500-crore recorded in the previous three years, and the Rs 5,272 crore (excluding VAT) that was garnered between September 1, 2022 and August 31, 2023 after the return to the old policy. Finally, in all the time that the ED has spent gathering evidence against AAP no one in the media has asked the most important question of all: if both the choice of wholesalers and retailers is made through public auctions, then where is there any space left for graft and favouritism? To the eternal shame of the Indian media, in the months since AAP leaders were imprisoned, no newspaper or television commentator has asked this question.",https://www.opindia.com/2024/05/modi-kejriwal-constitution-delhi-liquor-scam/,"Read the Constitution, read the law of the country: PM Modi’s advice to Delhi liquor scam accused Arvind Kejriwal","Rejecting opposition allegations about the misuse of probe agencies against them, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the government has a zero-tolerance towards corruption and that it is better “if these people read the Constitution, read the law of the country”. In an exclusive interview with ANI, PM Modi said the probe agencies were making more seizures in corruption cases. Asked about Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s allegation that PM Modi decides who will go to jail, the Prime Minister said, “It would be better if these people read the Constitution, read the law of the country, I do not need to say anything to anyone”. Kejriwal has been given interim bail by the Supreme Court till June 1 in the Delhi excise policy case. Kejriwal has been attacking the BJP and PM Modi in his rallies for the Lok Sabha polls. “In Bihar, Modi Ji said – ‘Tejashwi Yadav will go to jail in a few days.’ This clearly shows who will go to jail and for how many days will he stay in jail, this is decided by Modi Ji. When I said this a few days ago, I was asked how I was saying this. Yesterday Modi Ji accepted it in front of the whole country,” Kejriwal said in a post on X on May 26. PM Modi said that during his 10-year tenure, ED has seized Rs 2,200 crore while during Manmohan Singh’s 10-year tenure as Prime Minister, it was only Rs 34 lakh. “Ask the person who is throwing this garbage, what is the proof of what you are saying? I will convert this garbage into manure and will produce some good things for the country from it. When Manmohan Singh was in power for 10 years, Rs 34 lakhs were seized and currently in the last 10 years ED has seized Rs 2,200 crores. The one who has brought back Rs 2,200 crores to the country should be respected and not abused,” he said. “The one whose money has gone is abusing. It means that whoever has a part in stealing money will shout a little after being caught. Today, a Sarpanch has the right to sign on a chequebook but the Prime Minister of the country does not have it. Modi government has told its officers that it has zero tolerance towards corruption,” he added. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Ram, the former Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of The Hindu, has said they are “immoral, unethical and unacceptable”, adding that Modi owes Indian Muslims “many apologies”. In an interview to The Wire, Ram says the Election Commission should punish Modi by barring him from campaigning, as they did during the 2014 election in the case of Amit Shah, who was then president of the BJP. Ram adds that because Modi is prime minister, the punishment meted to him should be more severe than would be given to a normal minister or politician for a similar infringement of the Model Code of Conduct and the Representation of People Act Speaking about the Election Commission, Ram said it has “ceased to be an independent body” and called it “servile”. He said the Election Commission has got “worse and worse” over the last three elections. Ram said that after three days the Election Commission’s silence about Modi’s Rajasthan speech and Aligarh speech is “shocking”. He said “he can’t find words strong enough to deplore and condemn”. Asked if the present situation is a test of the credibility of the Election Commission, Ram replied: “Yes, to put it mildly”.

PM Modi stated that his election manifesto of the Congress party reflected Maoist ideology. During an election rally in Banswara, Rajasthan, PM Modi mentioned Rahul Gandhi’s promise to survey and share the country’s riches.Speaking about then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s speech in which he claimed that Muslims ought to be given the first right to the nation’s resources, PM Modi stated that if the Congress heads back to power, they will redistribute the nation’s wealth among Muslims, intruders, and those with multiple children. The Prime Minister’s address put Congress, Islamists, Leftists, and their media allies into a frenzy. Almost as soon as PM Modi delivered the address, a flurry of misinformation began to circulate claiming that the Prime Minister branded all Muslims in India as ‘Ghuspethiyas’ or ‘intruders’. Also, several Congress leaders and Islamists slammed PM Modi for speaking the truth out. On 22d April, former Karnataka Assembly Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar called PM Modi ‘Shani’, a planet which is often looked at as a malefic planet from the astrological lenses. “Modi is a shani which has gripped this country. We are waiting for June 4. We have prayed to God to rid the country of this Shani,” Ramesh Kumar said while campaigning in Rojarhalli village of Kolar taluk.“It is unfortunate to see that the seat once occupied by Indira Gandhi, who boosted the self-confidence of people belonging to all castes and communities, including women, is now occupied by Modi,” he added. The video of the speech by Kumar is making rounds on social media. “It is unfortunate to see that the seat once occupied by Indira Gandhi, who boosted the self-confidence of people belonging to all castes and communities, including women, is now occupied by Modi,” he added. The video of the speech by Kumar is making rounds on social media. The Congress party from its official platform posted several posts and videos calling PM Modi a liar. “PM Modi has a bad habit of lying. Once again, he was caught lying,” the X post by Congress read. Later, in another post, the Congress posted a caricature image of PM Modi and termed it a ‘face of lie’. “The Prime Minister of India is a liar,” one of the posts by Congress read. Further, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate who earlier had made vulgar comments against Kangana Ranaut, BJP candidate from Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, abused PM Modi and called him shameless. She slammed PM Modi for saying that Congress will not even spare women’s wedding necklaces. “In which manifesto is it written that the party is going to do that? What are you even reading?” she blatantly asked. The Congress in its manifesto said that everybody’s property would be surveyed and then the country’s riches would be shared. The property eventually would include traditional gold investments and ornaments owned by Indian families and women, which Shrinate probably forgot to understand. In his speech on Sunday, PM Modi emphasised, “They have said that if they form a government then a survey of property belonging to every person will be done. It will be checked how much gold our sisters own, how much money government employees have…They also said that gold owned by our sisters would be equally distributed. Does the govt have the right to take your property? ‘Mangalsutra’ sone ki keemat ka mudda nahi hai, unke sapno se juda hua hai…” Congress’ Rahul Gandhi also commented on the matter and didn’t hesitate to call PM Modi a liar. “After the disappointment in the first phase of voting, the level of Narendra Modi’s lies has fallen so much that out of fear, he now wants to divert the attention of the public from the issues. Trends have started coming in regarding the immense support that Congress’s ‘Revolutionary Manifesto’ is receiving. The country will now vote on its issues, vote for its employment, its family and its future. India will not go astray!” he said. Further, notorious Supreme Court advocate Prashant Bhushan who has a history of favouring the Congress party also posted a video of PM Modi, slamming him for speaking the truth. “When the elections seem to be slipping out of hand, they have to rant about Hindu-Muslim. The Election Commission will keep sleeping in the meantime,” Bhushan said. Meanwhile, Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge also commented on the issue and said, “What Modi ji said is not only a hate speech but also a well-thought-out ploy to divert attention. Today the Prime Minister did what he has learnt from the values ​​of the Sangh. Lying for power, making baseless references to things, and making false accusations about opponents are the specialties of the training of RSS and BJP. The 140 crore people of the country are no longer going to fall prey to this lie. Our manifesto is for every Indian. In the history of India, no Prime Minister has lowered the dignity of his post as much as Modiji has.”",,,,,,,

He charged the Modi government treats Agniveers as “use-and-throw labour”. Addressing in the Lok Sabha on the motion of thanks for the president’s address, Rahul Gandhi said, “Agnipath scheme is brainchild of PM Modi not of armed forces. When our government is formed, we will scrap the Agnipath scheme because we think it is against armed forces, patriots.” Gandhi charged an Agniveer lost his life in a landmine blast but he is not called a 'martyr'. “Agniveer' is ‘use-and-throw labour’,” the opposition leader said. Gandhi charged Agniveers do not receive any compensation. However, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh opposed Gandhi’s comments and said the Opposition leader was misleading the House. ""He should not try to mislead the House by making wrong statements. Financial assistance of Rs 1 crore is given to the family of the Agniveer who sacrifices his life while protecting our borders or during war,” Singh said. On NEET examinations, Gandhi charged it had been designed to benefit “rich students”. “Truth is NEET students do not believe in the exam, they think it's designed for rich students and not the meritorious,” he said. Gandhi added, “NEET students spend years preparing for their exam. Their family supports them financially, and emotionally. I have met several NEET students. Every single one of them tells me that the exam is designed to create a quota for rich people and to create a passage for them into the system and is designed not to help poor students.” During the address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi intervened when Gandhi said those who call themselves Hindus are engaged in violence and hate round the clock. “All religions and all our great men talk about non-violence and fearlessness, but those who call themselves Hindus only talk about violence, hatred and falsehood,” he said.

On Monday (1st July), Congress scion Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Agniveer scheme was not meant for the Indian army but for the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). During his 1.5-hour-long speech on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s Address, he also claimed that Agniveers are not eligible for death benefits.Rahul Gandhi, who is now the leader of the Opposition, had claimed that the Modi government treated Agniveers as ‘use and throw labourers’ and did not provide the status of a shaheed (martyr) on being killed in action.

“That house will not get pension and compensation (death benefits),” he alleged. However, as usual, the claims of the Congress scion are not rooted in truth.

His family will also receive full pay for the period unserved up to 4 years, including the Seva Nidhi fund (interest + contribution made by the government). In case a jawan dies in service while not on duty, he will receive insurance cover of ₹48 lakhs and the amount accumulated in the Seva Nidhi fund (interest + government contribution).

During the debate in Parliament, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had objected, “I would request the Leader of the Parliament to not mislead the nation by making false statements.” However, Rahul Gandhi kept on insisting that he was speaking the truth.Rahul Gandhi targets Hindu community
During his speech in the Parliament, Rahul Gandhi made communally divisive remarks against the Hindu community. His hateful remarks forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene, who said, “Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.”

Following a heated exchange between the Opposition and the ruling NDA’s MPs, Union Minister Amit Shah called for an apology from Rahul Gandhi.

Congress scion fearmongers about NEET
Rahul Gandhi also did not leave any stone unturned to spread canards about the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), an exam which is required to secure admission to medical school.

Amid the ongoing controversy, the Congress scion claimed, “NEET students spend years and years preparing for their exam. Their family supports them financially and emotionally. And the truth is NEET students now do not believe in the exam.”

He further alleged, “Because they are convinced that the exam is designed for rich people, not meritorious people.”

He claimed that those who called themselves Hindus only talked about violence, hatred, and untruth, triggering PM Modi to intervene over his remarks.

“All our great men have spoken about non-violence and eliminating fear… But those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth…” Rahul Gandhi was heard saying.
